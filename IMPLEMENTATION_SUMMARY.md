## ✅ Comment 2: Audit Logger Interface Unification - COMPLETED

### Implementation Details:
- **✅ Unified Interface**: Fixed all audit logging calls across security modules
  - `secure_messaging.go`: Updated to use `LogEvent(ctx, AuditEvent{...})`
  - `distributed_security_coordinator.go`: Context-aware logging with proper event structure
  - `security_monitoring.go`: Standardized event types and field mapping
  - `handlers.go`: HTTP context integration for request tracing

- **✅ Event Structure**: Standardized `AuditEvent` usage
  - `EventType` → Security event classification
  - `Actor` → User/system performing action
  - `Resource` → Target resource identifier
  - `Action`/`Result` → Operation performed and outcome
  - `Details` map → Additional contextual information
  - Context propagation for request correlation

### Fixed Patterns:
```go
// Before (broken)
auditLogger.LogEvent(security.AuditEvent{
  Type: "custom_type",
  Severity: "info",
  // ... incompatible fields
})

// After (fixed)
auditLogger.LogEvent(ctx, security.AuditEvent{
  EventType: security.EventConfigChange,
  Actor: "system",
  Resource: "resource_id",
  Action: security.ActionUpdate,
  Result: security.ResultSuccess,
  Details: map[string]interface{}{
    "description": "...",
    "severity": "info",
  },
})
```
