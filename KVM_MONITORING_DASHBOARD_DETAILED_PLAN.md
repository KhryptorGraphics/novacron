# Detailed Implementation Plan: KVM Hypervisor, Monitoring Integration, and Dashboard Development

_Last updated: April 11, 2025_

---

## 1. Finish KVM Hypervisor Implementation

### Objective
Complete all VM lifecycle operations in `kvm_manager.go` and fully integrate with libvirt for robust KVM management.

### Steps

#### A. Core VM Lifecycle Operations
- [ ] **CreateVM**: Implement XML domain definition generation, storage volume creation, and VM instantiation via libvirt.
- [ ] **StartVM**: Use libvirt to start a defined VM.
- [ ] **StopVM**: Implement both graceful shutdown and force stop.
- [ ] **RebootVM**: Add support for soft and hard reboots.
- [ ] **DeleteVM**: Ensure proper resource cleanup (volumes, network, metadata).
- [ ] **Suspend/ResumeVM**: Implement VM suspension and resumption.
- [ ] **ListVMs**: Retrieve and filter all domains, convert to NovaCron VM metadata.
- [ ] **GetVMStatus**: Map libvirt states to NovaCron VM states, implement status monitoring.

#### B. Resource Management
- [ ] **Disk Management**: Add disk creation, resizing, hot-plug, and storage pool support.
- [ ] **CPU/Memory Management**: Implement allocation, pinning, balloon driver, and resource adjustment for running VMs.
- [ ] **Network Management**: Add virtual network creation, interface management, MAC address management, and VLAN support.

#### C. Advanced Features
- [ ] **VM Migration**: Implement live and storage migration using libvirt APIs.
- [ ] **Snapshot Management**: Add snapshot creation, listing, revert, and deletion.
- [ ] **Template Management**: Support creating VMs from templates and template versioning.

#### D. Integration & Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Write tests for all methods using libvirt test drivers.
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests against real KVM environments.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document all methods, error scenarios, and limitations.

#### E. Success Metrics
- 100% of defined operations implemented and tested.
- >90% unit test coverage.
- Reliable operation in integration tests.

## 2. Complete Monitoring Integration Tests

### Objective
Finalize backend and provider-specific metric collectors, and ensure robust monitoring coverage.

### Steps

#### A. Backend Monitoring
- [ ] **Metric Registry**: Ensure all VM and hypervisor metrics are registered and exposed.
- [ ] **Alert Manager**: Complete alert rule configuration and notification channels.
- [ ] **Historical Data**: Implement storage and retrieval for historical metrics.

#### B. Provider-Specific Collectors
- [ ] **KVM Metrics**: Integrate libvirt statistics (CPU, memory, disk, network) into the monitoring backend.
- [ ] **Cloud Providers**: For AWS/Azure/GCP, implement metric collectors using respective SDKs (focus on EC2/VM stats, storage, network).

#### C. Testing
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Simulate metric collection from all providers, validate alerting and notification.
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**: Ensure metrics flow from source to dashboard and alerting.

#### D. Documentation
- [ ] **Collector Docs**: Document how to add new metric collectors and extend monitoring.

## 3. Advance Dashboard Development

### Objective
Implement real-time data binding and complete React components for a fully functional monitoring dashboard.

### Steps

#### A. Data Binding & Real-Time Updates
- [ ] **API Integration**: Connect frontend components to backend REST/WebSocket endpoints for metrics and alerts.
- [ ] **WebSocket Events**: Implement real-time updates for VM status, metrics, and alerts.
- [ ] **State Management**: Use Redux or Context API for global state.

#### B. Component Completion
- [ ] **MonitoringDashboard.tsx**: Replace placeholders with live data visualizations (charts, tables, status indicators).
- [ ] **UI Enhancements**: Add advanced filtering, sorting, and customization options.
- [ ] **User Preferences**: Implement persistent user settings (theme, layout, filters).

#### C. Testing & Accessibility
- [ ] **Component Tests**: Write unit and integration tests for all UI components.
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (ARIA, keyboard navigation).

#### D. Documentation
- [ ] **User Guide**: Document dashboard features and customization options.
