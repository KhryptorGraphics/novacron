## Environment Configurations

### Development Environment
- **Security Level:** Minimal (maximum accessibility)
- **SSH Access:** Open from any IP
- **Service Access:** All services publicly accessible
- **VNC Console:** Enabled
- **Monitoring:** Open access
- **Use Case:** Local development and testing

### Staging Environment  
- **Security Level:** Balanced
- **SSH Access:** Private networks only (RFC1918)
- **Service Access:** Web services + direct API access
- **VNC Console:** Disabled
- **Monitoring:** Private networks only
- **Use Case:** Pre-production testing

### Production Environment
- **Security Level:** Maximum (defense in depth)
- **SSH Access:** Management networks only
- **Service Access:** HTTPS primary, HTTP redirect only
- **VNC Console:** Disabled
- **Monitoring:** Private networks only
- **Database Access:** Localhost + private networks only
- **Use Case:** Production deployment

## Security Features

### Access Controls
- Network-based access restrictions using IP ranges
- Service-specific access policies
- Environment-appropriate security profiles
- Rate limiting for SSH and web services

### Security Hardening
- Default deny policy for incoming connections
- Principle of least privilege implementation
- Network segmentation support
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Production Security
- Database access restricted to localhost and private networks
- Monitoring services limited to management networks
- VNC console access disabled by default
- SSH access limited to management networks
- HTTPS enforcement with HTTP redirect

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install profiles
sudo ./scripts/install-ufw-profiles.sh

# Configure for production
sudo ./scripts/setup-ufw-rules.sh production

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

### Management Commands
```bash
# Check status
sudo ./scripts/ufw-helper.sh status

# Test connectivity
sudo ./scripts/ufw-helper.sh test api

# View logs
