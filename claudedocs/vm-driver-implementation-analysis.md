# VM Driver Implementation Analysis & Completion Plan

## Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Implemented Drivers**
1. **KVMDriverEnhanced** - Fully functional KVM driver with:
   - Complete lifecycle operations (Create, Start, Stop, Delete)
   - QEMU process management
   - VM state tracking and monitoring
   - Pause/Resume support
   - Snapshot functionality via qemu-img
   - Resource management (CPU, memory, disk)

2. **ContainerDriver** - Functional Docker container driver with:
   - Complete lifecycle operations
   - Resource limits (CPU shares, memory)
   - Environment and mount configuration
   - Pause/Resume support
   - Status monitoring and metrics

3. **KataContainersDriver** - Advanced secure container driver with:
   - VM-level isolation with container efficiency
   - CRIU-based snapshots and migration
   - Security policies and network management
   - Live migration capabilities

### ‚ùå **Missing/Incomplete Implementations**
1. **ContainerdDriverStub** - Only stub implementation, needs full containerd integration
2. **Process Driver** - Referenced in factory but not implemented
3. **Libvirt Integration** - KVM driver uses direct QEMU, should leverage go-libvirt

### üîß **Issues to Fix**

#### 1. Import Path Issues
- Circular dependencies with incorrect module paths
- Missing internal packages causing build failures
- Need to fix `github.com/novacron/backend/core/*` imports

#### 2. Missing Dependencies  
- containerd libraries are imported but may need proper integration
- go-libvirt is available but not used in KVM driver
- Missing context imports in test files

#### 3. Driver Factory Integration
- Process driver not implemented but referenced
- Need proper error handling for missing drivers

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Fix Build Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Fix Import Paths** - Resolve circular dependencies and incorrect module references
2. **Add Missing Context Import** - Fix test compilation
3. **Update go.mod** - Add missing dependencies

### Phase 2: Complete Containerd Driver (HIGH PRIORITY) 
1. **Replace ContainerdDriverStub** with full implementation
2. **Leverage containerd client libraries** 
3. **Implement all VMDriver interface methods**
4. **Add proper error handling and logging**

### Phase 3: Enhance KVM Driver (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Integrate go-libvirt** for better VM management
2. **Add proper migration support** 
3. **Improve resource monitoring**
4. **Add VM template support**

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Expand driver tests** with proper mocking
2. **Add integration tests** for each driver
3. **Test migration workflows** between drivers
4. **Validate resource limits and monitoring**

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)
1. **Implement Process Driver** - for process-based workloads
2. **Cross-driver migration** support
3. **Driver-specific optimizations**

## Architecture Recommendations

### Driver Factory Improvements
```go
// Enhanced error handling and driver availability checking
type DriverCapability struct {
    Available bool
    Error     error
    Features  []string
}

func (f *VMDriverFactory) GetDriverCapabilities() map[VMType]DriverCapability
```

### Migration Framework
```go
// Cross-driver migration support
type CrossDriverMigration interface {
    CanMigrate(from, to VMType) bool
    Migrate(ctx context.Context, fromDriver, toDriver VMDriver, vmID string) error
}
```

### Monitoring Integration  
```go
// Driver-specific metrics collection
type DriverMetrics interface {
    GetMetrics(ctx context.Context, vmID string) (*DriverSpecificMetrics, error)
    GetBulkMetrics(ctx context.Context) ([]*DriverSpecificMetrics, error)
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Fix build issues to get a compilable codebase
2. **Focus on ContainerdDriver** - Complete the most critical missing driver  
3. **Add comprehensive tests** - Ensure all drivers work as expected
4. **Validate integration** - Test with the broader NovaCron system

This analysis shows we have a solid foundation with the existing drivers, but need to complete the containerd implementation and fix build issues for a production-ready system.
