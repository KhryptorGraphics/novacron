- Missing QMP protocol support for advanced features
- No hardware acceleration features (CPU pinning, NUMA, device passthrough)
- Limited to basic VM lifecycle operations

### 🏆 Recommended Hypervisor Priority
**Based on market adoption, API maturity, and integration complexity:**

1. **KVM/QEMU (Priority 1)** - Foundation platform, excellent performance
2. **VMware vSphere (Priority 2)** - Enterprise market leader, mature APIs  
3. **Proxmox VE (Priority 3)** - Growing open-source adoption, REST API
4. **Hyper-V (Priority 4)** - Microsoft ecosystem integration
5. **XCP-ng (Priority 5)** - Citrix alternative, XAPI compatibility
