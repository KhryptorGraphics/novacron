### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to get new dev dependencies
2. **Test Configuration**: Run `npm run build` to verify all configs work
3. **Type Checking**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check TypeScript setup
4. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to verify ESLint configuration

### Development Workflow Integration
1. **Add to package.json scripts**:
   ```json
   {
     "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
     "lint:fix": "next lint --fix", 
     "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
     "analyze": "ANALYZE=true npm run build"
   }
   ```

2. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (recommended):
   ```json
   {
     "husky": {
       "hooks": {
         "pre-commit": "npm run type-check && npm run lint"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
