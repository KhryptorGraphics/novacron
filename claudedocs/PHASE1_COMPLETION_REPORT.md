- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Container**: Docker, Docker Compose

### Key Capabilities
1. **VM Management**: Full lifecycle management with migration support
2. **Storage**: Intelligent tiering with ML-based optimization
3. **Consensus**: Distributed state management with Raft
4. **APIs**: REST and GraphQL with real-time subscriptions
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

## Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality validation
- **Integration Tests**: Service interaction testing  
- **Chaos Tests**: Network partition and failure scenarios
- **Benchmark Tests**: Performance profiling
- **Stress Tests**: High-load scenarios with 200+ concurrent operations

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **VM Lifecycle Testing**: Comprehensive testing and refinement of VM operations
2. **Frontend Integration**: Connect React frontend with backend APIs
3. **Security Hardening**: Implement encryption, authentication, and authorization

### Medium Priority
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and developer documentation
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

### Future Enhancements

- **Concurrent Migrations**: Up to 100 simultaneous transfers
- **ML Prediction Confidence**: 70-90% accuracy
- **Consensus**: Sub-second leader election
- **API Response Time**: <100ms for most operations

## Project Status

The core infrastructure for NovaCron is now substantially complete with:
- ✅ Storage tiering with ML optimization
- ✅ Distributed consensus with Raft
- ✅ Comprehensive API layer (REST + GraphQL)
- ✅ Extensive testing infrastructure
- ⏳ Frontend integration (existing but needs connection)
- ⏳ Security implementation
- ⏳ Documentation and CI/CD

## Next Steps

1. Test and validate VM lifecycle management
2. Complete frontend-backend integration
3. Implement security features (JWT, RBAC, encryption)
4. Create user and developer documentation
5. Set up automated CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The NovaCron project has successfully implemented the core distributed VM management infrastructure with advanced features like ML-based storage optimization, distributed consensus, and comprehensive APIs. The system is architecturally sound and ready for the final integration and hardening phases.
