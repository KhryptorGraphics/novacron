- **Visualization Tab**: Interactive workflow graphs
- **Monitoring Tab**: Detailed execution tracking

### Visualization Components
- **JobExecutionChart**: Bar chart showing job execution frequency
- **WorkflowExecutionChart**: Workflow execution trends

- **ExecutionStatistics**: Key performance metrics
- **SystemStatus**: Infrastructure health monitoring

### Enhanced UI Features
- Auto-refresh controls with configurable intervals
- Execution search and filtering
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Loading states and error handling

## 4. Workflow Visualization/Management UI

### Interactive Workflow Graphs
- **WorkflowVisualization**: SVG-based workflow rendering
- Node status tracking (pending, running, completed, failed)
- Edge connections with directional arrows
- Interactive node selection for detailed information

### Workflow Management
- Create workflows with JSON-based node/edge definitions
- Edit existing workflows with form validation
- Execute workflows with real-time status tracking
- Delete workflows with confirmation dialogs

### Execution Monitoring
- **WorkflowExecutionMonitor**: Detailed execution tracking
- Node-level execution status and timing
- Progress bars for overall workflow completion
- Error message display for failed nodes

## 5. Production Deployment Configuration

### Docker Compose
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`: Production-ready multi-service deployment
- Database initialization with sample data
- Network isolation and volume management
- Resource limits and restart policies

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Namespace**: Isolated `novacron` namespace
- **ConfigMap**: Environment configuration management
- **Secrets**: Secure credential storage
- **Deployments**: API, Hypervisor, Frontend, MySQL, Redis
- **Services**: Internal service discovery
- **Ingress**: External access configuration
- **PersistentVolumes**: Data persistence for database

### Environment Configuration
