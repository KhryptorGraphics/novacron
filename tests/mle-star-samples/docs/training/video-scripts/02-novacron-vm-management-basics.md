## VM Lifecycle Management (2.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: VM creation interface]**

**Narrator**: "Let's start with VM lifecycle management. NovaCron handles everything from provisioning to decommissioning automatically."

**[SCREEN: VM template selection]**

**Narrator**: "We begin by selecting an appropriate VM template. NovaCron provides optimized templates for different ML workloads:"

- **CPU-Optimized**: Data preprocessing, traditional ML
- **GPU-Accelerated**: Deep learning, computer vision
- **Memory-Optimized**: Large dataset processing
- **Balanced**: General-purpose ML development

**[SCREEN: Automated provisioning in progress]**

```bash
# Demonstration command
novacron vm create --template gpu-ml-v2 --project cifar10-demo
```

**Narrator**: "Watch as NovaCron provisions a GPU-optimized VM. It automatically configures CUDA drivers, ML frameworks, and monitoring agents."

**[SCREEN: VM status dashboard showing provisioning stages]**

**Provisioning Stages**:
1. **Infrastructure**: Cloud resource allocation
2. **Base OS**: Operating system installation
3. **ML Stack**: Framework and library installation  
4. **Monitoring**: Agent deployment and configuration
5. **Validation**: Health checks and performance tests

**[SCREEN: VM successfully provisioned and ready]**

**Narrator**: "In under 5 minutes, we have a production-ready ML environment. Traditional setup would take hours of manual configuration."

## Resource Allocation and Optimization (3 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Resource allocation dashboard]**

**Narrator**: "Resource allocation is where NovaCron truly shines. It continuously optimizes CPU, memory, and GPU usage based on workload patterns."

**[SCREEN: Real-time resource monitoring graphs]**

**Narrator**: "Here's our CIFAR-10 training job running. Notice how NovaCron monitors resource utilization in real-time."

**[SCREEN: Resource optimization recommendations panel]**

**Smart Optimization Features**:
- **Dynamic CPU Scaling**: Adjusts cores based on parallelizable tasks
- **Memory Management**: Intelligent caching and swapping
- **GPU Utilization**: Optimal batch sizing and memory allocation
- **Network Optimization**: Bandwidth allocation for data loading

**[SCREEN: Before/after optimization comparison]**

**Narrator**: "NovaCron identified that our training job was memory-bound. It automatically increased memory allocation and adjusted batch size, improving training speed by 40%."

**[SCREEN: Cost impact visualization]**

**Resource Optimization Benefits**:
- 40% faster training completion
- 25% reduction in cloud costs
- 60% better GPU utilization
- Automated resource right-sizing

## Auto-scaling Capabilities (2.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Auto-scaling configuration interface]**

**Narrator**: "Auto-scaling ensures optimal resource availability without over-provisioning. Let's see how NovaCron handles varying workloads."

**[SCREEN: Scaling policy configuration]**

**Narrator**: "We can define scaling policies based on multiple metrics:"

- **CPU Utilization**: Scale when >80% for 5 minutes
- **Memory Pressure**: Add capacity when >85% used
- **Queue Depth**: Scale out when jobs queue beyond threshold
- **Cost Constraints**: Respect budget limits during scaling

**[SCREEN: Live scaling event demonstration]**

**Narrator**: "I'm submitting multiple training jobs simultaneously. Watch how NovaCron responds."

**[SCREEN: Dashboard showing scaling trigger]**

```bash
# Simulate workload burst
for i in {1..5}; do
  novacron job submit --config training-config-$i.yaml
done
```

**[SCREEN: New VMs being provisioned]**

**Narrator**: "NovaCron detected the increased workload and is provisioning additional VMs. The entire process is automated and takes under 3 minutes."

**[SCREEN: Load distribution across scaled VMs]**

**Auto-scaling Benefits**:
- Zero manual intervention
- Sub-3-minute response time
- Intelligent load distribution
- Automatic scale-down during low usage
- Cost-aware scaling decisions

## Performance Monitoring (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Comprehensive monitoring dashboard]**

**Narrator**: "Effective VM management requires comprehensive monitoring. NovaCron provides multi-dimensional visibility into system performance."

**[SCREEN: System metrics overview]**

**Key Monitoring Dimensions**:
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Application**: ML job progress, model performance metrics  
- **Cost**: Real-time spend tracking and optimization
- **Health**: System alerts and predictive maintenance

**[SCREEN: Alerting configuration interface]**

**Narrator**: "Intelligent alerting prevents issues before they impact workloads. We can configure alerts based on trends, not just thresholds."

**[SCREEN: Alert triggered - GPU temperature warning]**

**Sample Alert**: "GPU temperature trending upward - proactive cooling adjustment initiated automatically."

**[SCREEN: Historical performance trends]**

**Narrator**: "Historical analysis helps optimize resource allocation for future workloads. NovaCron learns from past patterns to improve predictions."

## Cost Optimization Strategies (2.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Cost optimization dashboard]**

**Narrator**: "Cost optimization is critical for ML workloads. NovaCron provides sophisticated cost management capabilities."

**[SCREEN: Cost breakdown analysis]**

**Cost Optimization Features**:
- **Spot Instance Usage**: Automatic spot/on-demand balancing
- **Resource Right-sizing**: Continuous optimization recommendations
- **Idle Detection**: Automatic shutdown of unused resources
- **Budget Alerts**: Proactive cost monitoring and controls

**[SCREEN: Spot instance management interface]**

**Narrator**: "For non-critical workloads, NovaCron can use spot instances, reducing costs by up to 70% while managing interruptions gracefully."

**[SCREEN: Spot instance interruption handling demo]**

**Narrator**: "When a spot instance is interrupted, NovaCron automatically migrates the workload to available capacity without data loss."
