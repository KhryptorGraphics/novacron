## Training Performance Optimization (4.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Training performance baseline measurement]**

**Narrator**: "Let's start with training optimization using our CIFAR-10 project. First, we establish baseline performance metrics to measure improvement accurately."

**[SCREEN: Initial training run with performance metrics]**

**Baseline Metrics**:
- **Training Time**: 4.2 hours for 100 epochs
- **GPU Utilization**: 65% average
- **Memory Usage**: 8.2GB peak
- **Throughput**: 1,200 samples/second
- **Cost**: $12.50 per training run

**[SCREEN: Performance profiling interface showing bottlenecks]**

**Narrator**: "Performance profiling reveals our bottlenecks: data loading is consuming 30% of training time, and GPU memory is underutilized due to small batch sizes."

### Data Pipeline Optimization

**[SCREEN: Data loading optimization implementation]**

**Narrator**: "Let's optimize our data pipeline first. We'll implement parallel data loading, prefetching, and memory pinning."

```python
# Optimized data loader configuration
optimized_loader = DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=256,        # Increased from 128
    num_workers=8,         # Parallel data loading
    pin_memory=True,       # Faster GPU transfer
    persistent_workers=True, # Reduce worker startup overhead
    prefetch_factor=4      # Background prefetching
)
```

**Data Pipeline Results**:
- **Loading Time**: Reduced from 40ms to 8ms per batch (80% improvement)
- **GPU Idle Time**: Reduced from 25% to 5%

### Memory and Batch Size Optimization

**[SCREEN: Memory usage analysis and optimization]**

**Narrator**: "Next, we optimize memory usage to enable larger batch sizes, which improve GPU utilization and training stability."

**[SCREEN: Gradient accumulation implementation]**

```python
# Memory-efficient training with gradient accumulation
def optimized_training_step(model, data_loader, optimizer):
    accumulation_steps = 4
    
    for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(data_loader):
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets) / accumulation_steps
        
        # Backward pass with gradient accumulation
        loss.backward()
        
        if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
```

from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel

# Initialize distributed training
dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')
model = DistributedDataParallel(model)

# Distributed data loading

# Calibrate with representative data
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in calibration_loader:

```python
# Structured pruning implementation
import torch.nn.utils.prune as prune

# Prune 30% of weights in each layer
for module in model.modules():
    if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Conv2d):
        prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=0.3)

# Knowledge distillation setup
class DistillationLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.5, temperature=4):
        super().__init__()
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.temperature = temperature
        
    def forward(self, student_logits, teacher_logits, targets):
        distillation_loss = F.kl_div(
            F.log_softmax(student_logits / self.temperature, dim=1),
            F.softmax(teacher_logits / self.temperature, dim=1),
            reduction='batchmean'
        ) * self.temperature ** 2
        
        student_loss = F.cross_entropy(student_logits, targets)
        return self.alpha * distillation_loss + (1 - self.alpha) * student_loss
```

### Deployment Optimization

```python
# TorchScript compilation
model_scripted = torch.jit.script(model)
model_scripted.save('model_optimized.pt')

# ONNX export for cross-platform optimization
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, 'model.onnx',
                  input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'],
                  dynamic_axes={'input': {0: 'batch_size'}})
