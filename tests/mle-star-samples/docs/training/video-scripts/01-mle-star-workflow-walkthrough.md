## Stage 1: Situation Analysis (2.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Computer Vision project - CIFAR-10 dataset exploration]**

**Narrator**: "Let's start with Stage 1: Situation Analysis. This stage is about understanding your data and problem domain."

**[SCREEN: Show code execution - data loading and visualization]**

```python
# Demonstration script
from computer_vision.src.data_loader import CIFAR10DataLoader
loader = CIFAR10DataLoader()
stats = loader.analyze_dataset()
```

**Narrator**: "Watch as we analyze the CIFAR-10 dataset. We're examining class distribution, image characteristics, and potential challenges."

**[SCREEN: Generated visualizations - class distribution, sample images]**

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Data quality assessment
- Class imbalance detection  
- Preprocessing requirements identification
- Problem complexity evaluation

**Narrator**: "The situation analysis produces a comprehensive report that guides all subsequent stages. Notice how we identify class imbalance in the 'cat' and 'dog' categories - this insight will influence our training strategy."

## Stage 2: Task Definition (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Task specification interface]**

**Narrator**: "Stage 2 transforms our understanding into specific ML objectives. We define success metrics, model constraints, and quality gates."

**[SCREEN: Configuration file - mle_star_config.yaml]**

**Narrator**: "Here's our task definition for CIFAR-10 classification:"

- **Primary metric**: 85% accuracy target
- **Secondary metrics**: Per-class precision and recall  
- **Constraints**: <4-hour training time, <50MB model size
- **Quality gates**: Minimum 75% validation accuracy

**[SCREEN: Success criteria matrix]**

**Narrator**: "Clear task definition prevents scope creep and ensures measurable outcomes. Every stakeholder understands exactly what success looks like."

## Stage 3: Action Planning (2.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Architecture design interface]**

**Narrator**: "Stage 3 designs our solution architecture and training strategy. This is where we make critical technical decisions."

**[SCREEN: Model architecture visualization - ResNet-inspired CNN]**

**Narrator**: "For CIFAR-10, we're using a ResNet-inspired CNN with these key components:"

- Initial convolution: 3 â†’ 64 channels
- 4 residual blocks with skip connections
- Global average pooling
- Dropout regularization

**[SCREEN: Training pipeline diagram]**

**Narrator**: "Our training pipeline includes data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping. Each component is justified by our situation analysis."

**[SCREEN: Code demonstration - model definition]**

```python
class CIFAR10CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=10, dropout_rate=0.5):
        # Architecture implementation
```

**Narrator**: "The action plan becomes our implementation blueprint, reducing development uncertainty and improving reproducibility."

## Stage 4: Implementation (3 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Training dashboard - real-time metrics]**

**Narrator**: "Stage 4 brings our plan to life. Watch as we train our model with comprehensive logging and monitoring."

**[SCREEN: Terminal showing training progress]**

```bash
python computer-vision/src/trainer.py
# Real-time training output
```

**Narrator**: "Our implementation includes automated checkpointing, metric tracking, and failure recovery. Notice the TensorBoard integration providing real-time visualization."

**[SCREEN: TensorBoard interface showing training curves]**

**Key Implementation Features**:
- Automated hyperparameter validation
- Progressive checkpoint saving  
- Memory optimization techniques
- Distributed training support

**[SCREEN: Training completion summary]**

**Narrator**: "After 2.5 hours of training, we've achieved 87% accuracy - exceeding our 85% target. The implementation stage produces trained models, training history, and comprehensive logs."

## Stage 5: Results Evaluation (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Evaluation dashboard with metrics]**

**Narrator**: "Stage 5 provides comprehensive model assessment. We go beyond simple accuracy to understand model behavior."

**[SCREEN: Confusion matrix heatmap]**

**Narrator**: "The confusion matrix reveals model strengths and weaknesses. We see excellent performance on 'ship' and 'truck' classes, but some confusion between 'cat' and 'dog'."

**[SCREEN: Per-class analysis charts]**

**Key Evaluation Components**:
- Multi-metric assessment (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Error analysis and misclassification patterns
- Performance across different data subsets
- Computational efficiency metrics

**[SCREEN: Sample predictions with confidence scores]**

**Narrator**: "Visual analysis of predictions helps us understand model decision-making and identify improvement opportunities."

## Stage 6: Refinement (2.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Hyperparameter tuning interface]**

**Narrator**: "Stage 6 optimizes our model through systematic refinement. We use the evaluation insights to guide improvements."

**[SCREEN: Hyperparameter search results]**

**Narrator**: "Based on our evaluation, we're testing different learning rates, dropout values, and data augmentation strategies."

**[SCREEN: Ablation study results]**

**Refinement Techniques Demonstrated**:
- Automated hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Architecture modifications based on error analysis
- Data augmentation optimization
- Learning rate schedule refinement

**[SCREEN: Before/after performance comparison]**

## Stage 7: Deployment Preparation (2 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Model export and optimization interface]**

**Narrator**: "The final stage prepares our model for production deployment. This includes optimization, serialization, and documentation."

**[SCREEN: Model conversion to TorchScript]**

```python
# Model optimization for production
model_scripted = torch.jit.script(model)
model_scripted.save('models/cifar10_optimized.pt')
```
