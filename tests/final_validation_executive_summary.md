## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Critical Path (6-7 Hours):

**Hour 1**: Backend Import Fix
```bash
# Fix import paths across all backend files
find backend/ -name "*.go" -exec sed -i 's|novacron/backend/|github.com/khryptorgraphics/novacron/backend/|g' {} \;
go build ./backend/... # Validate fix
```

**Hours 2-4**: Frontend Debugging  
```bash
# Debug null pointer exceptions
cd frontend && npm run dev # Identify specific component issues
# Fix map access errors in React components
# Test build: npm run build
```

**Hour 5**: VM Module Fixes
```bash
# Fix test function conflicts
cd backend/core/vm
# Resolve TestVMDriverManager redeclaration
# Add missing fmt imports
```

**Hours 6-7**: Integration Validation
```bash
# Run full test suite after fixes
make test-unit test-integration
# Performance testing  
# Security validation
```

## üìû STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION

### For Engineering Leadership:
"Core architectural foundation is excellent with 76/76 passing tests in orchestration. Critical compilation issues prevent deployment but are fixable within 6-7 hours."

### For Product Management:  
"Advanced features are fully implemented and tested. User-facing components need fixes before demo. Infrastructure is production-ready."

### For Operations:
"Monitoring, security, and infrastructure components are deployment-ready. API and frontend fixes required before go-live."
