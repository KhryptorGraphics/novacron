## 5. Establish Regular Status Meetings and Reviews

### Objective
Create a cadence of meetings and reviews to ensure effective communication and timely issue resolution.

### Actions

#### 5.1 Define Meeting Structure (Days 1-2)

## Timeline and Dependencies

The immediate action plan is designed to be completed within two weeks, with the following high-level timeline:

### Week 1
- Days 1-2: Implementation plan review session
- Days 1-3: Skills assessment and tool selection
- Days 3-5: Technical validation
- Days 4-6: Resource allocation planning

### Week 2
- Days 6-7: Finalize implementation plans
- Days 7-10: Confirm resource availability
- Days 6-8: Implement reporting processes
- Days 7-10: Conduct kickoff meetings
- Days 8-10: Begin critical path implementation

### Dependencies
- Executive approval required for resource allocation
- Access to development environments needed for critical path implementation
- Tool licenses and access required for project tracking setup

## Success Criteria

The immediate action plan will be considered successful when:

1. All implementation plans are reviewed, adjusted, and approved
2. Resources are allocated to all workstreams with clear roles and responsibilities
3. Project tracking and reporting mechanisms are in place and operational
4. Initial implementation of critical path items has begun with validated approach
5. Regular meeting cadence is established with active participation

## Next Steps After Completion

Upon completion of this immediate action plan, the team will:

1. Transition to full implementation of Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)
2. Begin tracking progress against the implementation roadmap
3. Conduct first milestone review at the end of Month 1
4. Adjust plans based on initial implementation feedback

This immediate action plan provides a clear path to initiate the NovaCron implementation roadmap and establish the foundation for successful project execution.
