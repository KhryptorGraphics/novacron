# NovaCron Master Developer Reference: Development Status & Roadmap

_Last updated: April 11, 2025_

This document provides an accurate assessment of NovaCron's current development status based on examination of the codebase, documentation, and implementation progress. It supersedes PROJECT_MASTERPLAN.md, which contains overly optimistic completion claims.

## Executive Summary

NovaCron is a distributed VM management system with advanced migration capabilities and multi-cloud support. While the core architecture and distributed backend components are relatively mature, significant work remains in several key areas:

- **Provider Integrations**: Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and hypervisor integrations remain incomplete
- **Frontend Dashboard**: In very early stages of development
- **Monitoring System**: Core backend exists but integration tests are incomplete (~40%)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Framework exists but implementation of advanced features remains

This document outlines what has been accomplished, what's in progress, and what remains to be done.

## 1. What's Been Accomplished

### Core Backend & Distributed Architecture
- **VM Migration**: Cold, warm, and live migration with WAN optimization and delta sync
- **Distributed Control Plane**: Multi-node support, cluster formation, Raft-based consensus
- **Resource-Aware Scheduling (Basic)**: Node resource tracking, workload profiling, basic placement logic
- **Multi-Tenancy & RBAC**: Role-based access control, tenant isolation, audit logging
- **Distributed Storage**: Volume management, sharding, replication, data healing
- **High Availability**: Service redundancy, failover, distributed state recovery
- **Federation (Basic)**: Multi-cluster management architecture established

### Monitoring & Analytics Infrastructure
- **Backend Framework**: Core monitoring framework, metric registry, alert manager, notification system
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Basic pipeline structure for data processing, analyzers, visualizers, and reporters

### API & Service Layer
- **REST API**: Core API endpoints for VM lifecycle management
- **WebSocket Services**: Basic event subscription system

---

## 2. What's In Progress/Incomplete

### Cloud Provider & Hypervisor Integrations
- **AWS Provider**: Skeleton implementation with mock/stub methods
  - Not integrated with monitoring system
  - Fake data for testing purposes only

- **Azure/GCP Providers**: Placeholder files only

- **KVM Hypervisor Manager**: Basic structure with TODOs
  - API defined but implementation incomplete
  - Critical methods like CreateVM, DeleteVM, etc. not fully implemented
  - Metric collection integration incomplete

### Monitoring & Dashboard
- **Integration Tests**: Only ~40% complete for monitoring
- **Provider Monitoring**: Integration with cloud/hypervisor providers incomplete
- **Dashboard Frontend**: Extremely basic React components with placeholders
  - MonitoringDashboard.tsx shows placeholder UI elements
  - No functional data binding or real-time updates
  - No alert management UI

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning integration not started
- **Predictive Alerting**: Not implemented
- **Visualizations**: Basic framework exists but specific visualizations incomplete

---

## 3. Implementation Gaps Analysis

### Provider Integration Gaps
1. **AWS Provider**:
   - Missing real AWS SDK integration for API calls
   - Missing CloudWatch metrics integration
   - Using placeholder data instead of actual AWS responses

2. **KVM Manager**:
   - Missing libvirt integration for VM operations
   - Key methods explicitly marked with "not yet implemented"
   - Missing VM metric collection capabilities

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - UI is incomplete with placeholder elements
   - CSS styling and layout issues
   - No data binding to backend services

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Only basic alert tests implemented
   - Provider-specific monitoring tests missing
   - End-to-end system tests absent

---

## 4. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Provider Integration Completion**
   - Complete AWS provider with real SDK integration
   - Implement KVM manager with libvirt
   - Add metric collection for cloud providers

2. **Monitoring System Completion**
   - Finish integration tests for monitoring components
   - Complete provider-specific metric collectors
   - Implement telemetry data pipeline

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Complete React component implementation
   - Add data binding to backend services
   - Implement real-time updates via WebSocket

4. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Develop example configurations for common use cases
   - Create user guides for each major subsystem
