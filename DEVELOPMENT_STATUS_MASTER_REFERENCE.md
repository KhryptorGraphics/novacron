## Executive Summary

NovaCron is a distributed VM management system with advanced migration, multi-cloud, and high-availability features. The core backend and distributed architecture are mature, but significant work remains in cloud provider integrations, hypervisor management, monitoring, analytics, and the frontend dashboard. This document outlines what’s done, what’s in progress, and what’s left, with a realistic roadmap and actionable next steps.

## Completed Work

### Core Backend & Distributed Architecture
- **VM Migration:** Cold, warm, and live migration with WAN optimization and delta sync.
- **Distributed Control Plane:** Multi-node support, cluster formation, Raft-based consensus.
- **Resource-Aware Scheduling (Basic):** Node resource tracking, workload profiling, basic placement logic.
- **Multi-Tenancy & RBAC:** Role-based access control, tenant isolation, audit logging.
- **Distributed Storage:** Volume management, sharding, replication, data healing.
- **High Availability:** Service redundancy, failover, distributed state recovery.
- **Federation (Basic):** Multi-cluster management architecture established.

### Monitoring & Analytics Infrastructure
- **Backend Framework:** Core monitoring framework, metric registry, alert manager, notification system.
- **Analytics Pipeline:** Basic pipeline structure for data processing, analyzers, visualizers, and reporters.

### API & Service Layer
- **REST API:** Core API endpoints for VM lifecycle management.
- **WebSocket Services:** Basic event subscription system.

### Frontend
- **UI Component Library:** Modern, reusable components (~90% complete).
- **Monitoring Dashboard:** Initial implementation with multiple tabs and visualization options.

---

## In-Progress Items

### Cloud Provider & Hypervisor Integrations
- **AWS Provider:** Skeleton implementation with mock/stub methods. Not integrated with monitoring. No real AWS API calls.
- **Azure/GCP Providers:** Placeholder files only.
- **KVM Hypervisor Manager:** Basic structure with TODOs. API defined but implementation incomplete. Critical methods (CreateVM, DeleteVM, etc.) not fully implemented.

### Monitoring & Dashboard
- **Integration Tests:** Only ~40% complete for monitoring.
- **Provider Monitoring:** Integration with cloud/hypervisor providers incomplete.
- **Dashboard Frontend:** React components are placeholders; no functional data binding or real-time updates.

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Advanced Analytics:** Machine learning integration not started.
- **Predictive Alerting:** Not implemented.
- **Visualizations:** Basic framework exists but specific visualizations incomplete.

### Backend Services
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Basic implementation, lacks advanced features (MFA, OAuth, full RBAC).
- **High Availability Manager:** Framework defined, limited functional implementation.

---

## Remaining Tasks

### Cloud Provider Integration
- Implement all real AWS SDK calls, error handling, retry logic, and pagination.
- Integrate AWS CloudWatch for metrics.
- Complete Azure and GCP provider implementations with full SDK integration and resource management.
- Develop provider health monitoring, dynamic configuration, and credential rotation.

### Hypervisor Layer
- Implement all core VM lifecycle operations in KVM manager.
- Add storage volume management, metrics collection, migration, snapshot, and template support.
- Complete hypervisor interface implementations for VMware, Xen, and cross-hypervisor migration.

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Complete cloud provider metrics integration.
- Finish alert management and notification system.
- Implement threshold configuration, historical data analysis, and advanced analytics (predictive, anomaly detection, ML integration).

### Frontend
- Complete dashboard real-time updates, customization, and user preference storage.
- Add advanced filtering, sorting, and comprehensive documentation.

### Backend Services
- Complete RBAC, MFA, OAuth, and session management.
- Implement robust failover, cluster state management, leader election, and split-brain protection in HA manager.

   - Add data binding to backend services.
   - Implement real-time updates via WebSocket.

4. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation.
   - Develop example configurations for common use cases.
   - Create user guides for each major subsystem.

## Risk Analysis & Critical Dependencies

### Technical Risks
- **Provider SDK/API Changes:** Mitigate with abstraction layers and regular updates.
- **Hypervisor Compatibility Issues:** Extensive testing and containerized test environments.
- **Performance at Scale:** Early load testing and benchmarking.

### Resource Risks
- **Specialized Expertise Gaps:** Training and targeted hiring/contracting.
- **Timeline Pressure:** Modular development and prioritization of core features.

### Critical Dependencies
- AWS SDK for Go (v2), Azure SDK for Go, Google Cloud Go SDK, go-libvirt for KVM.
- React, D3.js, Material-UI for frontend.
- Mock cloud environments and test VMs for integration testing.
