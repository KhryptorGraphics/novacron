# Cloud Provider Removal Report

## Overview

All cloud service provider integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) have been successfully removed from the NovaCron project as requested. The project now focuses on local hypervisor management and on-premises infrastructure.

## Removed Components

### 1. Storage Providers
- ✅ **Deleted**: `backend/core/storage/providers/s3/s3_provider.go`
- ✅ **Deleted**: `backend/core/storage/providers/azure/azure_provider.go`
- ✅ **Deleted**: `backend/core/storage/providers/s3/` directory
- ✅ **Deleted**: `backend/core/storage/providers/azure/` directory

### 2. Object Storage Updates
- ✅ **Updated**: `backend/core/plugins/storage/object/driver.go`
  - Removed S3, GCS, and Azure authentication methods
  - Updated to support only Swift and local storage
  - Removed AWS-specific configuration options
  - Updated documentation and comments

### 3. Configuration Updates
- ✅ **Updated**: Object storage configuration to use "local" as default provider
- ✅ **Updated**: Provider type documentation to reflect supported providers
- ✅ **Updated**: Plugin descriptions to remove cloud provider references

## Updated Architecture

### Storage Providers Now Supported
1. **Local Storage**: Direct filesystem-based storage
2. **OpenStack Swift**: Open-source object storage
3. **Ceph**: Distributed storage system
4. **NetFS**: Network filesystem storage

### Removed Dependencies
- AWS SDK references
- Azure SDK references
- Google Cloud SDK references
- Cloud-specific authentication mechanisms
- Cloud-specific configuration options

## Impact on Project

### Positive Changes
- ✅ **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex cloud integrations
- ✅ **Reduced Dependencies**: No external cloud SDK dependencies
- ✅ **Focus on Core**: Concentrated on hypervisor and local infrastructure
- ✅ **Self-Contained**: Project can run entirely on-premises

### Updated Documentation
- Implementation priorities updated to focus on local systems
- Removed cloud provider implementation plans
- Updated storage driver descriptions

## Remaining Storage Options

The project now supports these storage backends:

1. **Local File Storage**
   - Direct filesystem access
   - High performance for local workloads
   - Simple configuration

2. **Distributed Storage (Ceph)**
   - Enterprise-grade distributed storage
   - Replication and redundancy
   - Scalable across multiple nodes

3. **Network Storage (NetFS)**
   - NFS and similar network filesystems
   - Shared storage across nodes
   - Standard protocols

4. **Object Storage (Swift)**
   - OpenStack Swift compatibility
   - RESTful API access
   - Scalable object storage

## Configuration Changes

### Before (with cloud providers):
```go
Provider: "s3"
Endpoint: "s3.amazonaws.com"
```

### After (local focus):
```go
Provider: "local"
Endpoint: "localhost:8090"
```

## Next Steps

With cloud providers removed, the project can focus on:

1. **Enhanced KVM Management**: Improve local hypervisor capabilities
2. **Distributed Storage**: Optimize Ceph and local storage performance
3. **Network Management**: Enhance local network virtualization
4. **Monitoring**: Focus on local infrastructure monitoring
5. **High Availability**: Implement local cluster management

## Verification

To verify cloud providers are completely removed:

```bash
# Search for any remaining cloud references
grep -r "aws\|azure\|gcp\|s3\|amazon" backend/ --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "google.*cloud\|microsoft.*azure" backend/ --exclude-dir=.git
```

All cloud provider integrations have been successfully removed, and the project now operates as a pure on-premises virtualization management system.
