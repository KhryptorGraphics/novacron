## Project Overview

NovaCron is a distributed VM management system with advanced migration capabilities. It provides a platform for managing virtualized workloads across distributed nodes, with a focus on efficient and reliable migration between hosts. The system is designed to handle various virtualization technologies and optimize workload placement based on resource availability and constraints.

### Key Features

- **Advanced VM Migration**: Support for cold, warm, and live migration with minimal downtime
- **WAN-Optimized Transfers**: Efficient transfer of VM data across wide area networks
- **Multi-Driver Support**: Compatible with various virtualization technologies (KVM, containers)
- **Resource-Aware Scheduling**: Intelligent VM placement based on available resources
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Distributed architecture for scaling across multiple nodes

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

**Focus**: Building robust VM migration capabilities and core infrastructure.

### Phase 2: Distributed Architecture (Current - Q2 2025)

**Focus**: Extending to multi-node support and building a distributed control plane.

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Q3-Q4 2025)

**Focus**: Adding features required for production enterprise environments.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem and Extensions (2026)

**Focus**: Building an ecosystem around NovaCron with plugins and extensions.

## Current Focus: Resource-Aware Scheduler

The immediate priority is implementing the Resource-Aware Scheduler component, which is a critical milestone for Phase 2.
