- [ ] Storage and disk space monitoring
- [ ] Resource utilization alerting

### Section 5: Deployment & Recovery (Weight: 15%)

**Instructions**: Validate deployment processes and disaster recovery capabilities.

#### 5.1 Deployment Processes
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline configured
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployment strategy
- [ ] Deployment validation and smoke tests
- [ ] Database migration procedures
- [ ] Configuration deployment validation

#### 5.2 Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented
- [ ] RTO and RPO requirements validated
- [ ] Failover procedures tested
- [ ] Data center redundancy implemented

## Scoring Guidelines

**Pass Criteria**: Component ready for production with evidence of testing
**Fail Criteria**: Component not ready or critical issues identified
**Partial Criteria**: Component mostly ready but needs minor adjustments
**N/A Criteria**: Not applicable to current deployment architecture

## Final Assessment Instructions

Calculate pass rate by section:
- Section 1 (Infrastructure): __/10 items × 25% = __% 
- Section 2 (Configuration): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 3 (Security): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 4 (Monitoring): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 5 (Deployment): __/10 items × 15% = __%

**Overall Deployment Readiness Score**: __/100%

## Recommendations Template

For each failed or partial item:
1. Current deployment status
2. Risk assessment for production deployment
3. Required remediation actions
4. Implementation timeline and dependencies
5. Go/no-go decision factors
