# Technical Debt Assessment Checklist

## Overview
This checklist identifies, quantifies, and prioritizes technical debt across code quality, architecture, and maintenance aspects.

## Required Artifacts
- Code analysis reports
- Architecture documentation
- Maintenance and bug reports
- Performance metrics
- Developer productivity metrics

## Validation Criteria

### Section 1: Code Quality Assessment (Weight: 30%)

**Instructions**: Evaluate code quality metrics, maintainability, and technical standards compliance.

#### 1.1 Code Metrics
- [ ] Code complexity (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
- [ ] Code duplication levels (< 5% duplication)
- [ ] Code coverage (> 80% test coverage)
- [ ] Code review compliance (> 95% of changes reviewed)
- [ ] Coding standards adherence (linting rules compliance)

#### 1.2 Maintainability Indicators
- [ ] Function and class size within guidelines
- [ ] Dependency management and update practices
- [ ] Documentation coverage and quality
- [ ] Refactoring frequency and success rate
- [ ] Technical debt tracking and resolution

### Section 2: Architecture & Design Debt (Weight: 25%)

**Instructions**: Assess architectural decisions, design patterns, and scalability considerations.

#### 2.1 Architecture Quality
- [ ] SOLID principles adherence in design
- [ ] Design pattern usage appropriateness
- [ ] Service coupling and cohesion metrics
- [ ] API design consistency and RESTful compliance
- [ ] Database schema normalization and optimization

#### 2.2 Scalability & Performance Design
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation and effectiveness
- [ ] Database indexing and query optimization
- [ ] Asynchronous processing implementation
- [ ] Load balancing and horizontal scaling support
- [ ] Resource utilization optimization

### Section 3: Technology & Infrastructure Debt (Weight: 20%)

**Instructions**: Evaluate technology stack currency, infrastructure as code, and operational efficiency.

#### 3.1 Technology Stack Currency
- [ ] Framework and library versions (< 2 major versions behind)
- [ ] Security patches and updates current
- [ ] End-of-life technology identification and migration plans
- [ ] Language version currency and feature utilization
- [ ] Third-party dependency risk assessment

#### 3.2 Infrastructure & Deployment
- [ ] Infrastructure as code implementation
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline maturity
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Container and orchestration best practices
- [ ] Cloud service optimization and cost management

### Section 4: Testing & Quality Assurance Debt (Weight: 15%)

**Instructions**: Assess testing strategy, automation coverage, and quality assurance processes.

#### 4.1 Test Coverage & Quality
- [ ] Unit test coverage and quality
- [ ] Integration test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] End-to-end test automation
- [ ] Performance and load testing coverage
- [ ] Security testing integration

#### 4.2 Quality Assurance Processes
- [ ] Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Automated quality gates and checks
- [ ] Bug detection and resolution time metrics
- [ ] Code review process effectiveness
- [ ] Quality metrics tracking and improvement

### Section 5: Documentation & Knowledge Debt (Weight: 10%)

**Instructions**: Evaluate documentation completeness, knowledge management, and team onboarding efficiency.

#### 5.1 Documentation Quality
- [ ] API documentation completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Architecture and design documentation
- [ ] Operational runbooks and procedures
- [ ] Developer onboarding documentation
- [ ] System configuration and setup guides

#### 5.2 Knowledge Management
- [ ] Knowledge sharing practices and tools
- [ ] Code commenting and inline documentation
- [ ] Decision logs and architectural decision records
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides and FAQ
- [ ] Team knowledge distribution and bus factor

## Scoring Guidelines

**Pass Criteria**: Meets industry best practices with minimal technical debt
**Fail Criteria**: Significant technical debt requiring immediate attention
**Partial Criteria**: Some technical debt present but manageable
**N/A Criteria**: Not applicable to current system or team structure

## Technical Debt Prioritization Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Priority | Action |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| High | Low | Critical | Fix immediately |
| High | Medium | High | Plan for next sprint |
| High | High | Medium | Plan for next quarter |
| Medium | Low | Medium | Fix when opportunity arises |
| Low | Low | Low | Consider fixing during refactoring |
| Low | High | Ignore | Document but don't fix |

## Final Assessment Instructions

Calculate pass rate by section:
- Section 1 (Code Quality): __/10 items × 30% = __% 
- Section 2 (Architecture): __/10 items × 25% = __%
- Section 3 (Technology): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 4 (Testing): __/10 items × 15% = __%
- Section 5 (Documentation): __/10 items × 10% = __%

**Overall Technical Debt Assessment Score**: __/100%

## Debt Categories and Impact

### Code Debt
- Maintenance cost increase: 15-30%
- Development velocity impact: 20-40%
- Bug introduction risk: 25-50% increase

### Architecture Debt  
- Scalability limitations: Major impact
- Performance degradation: 10-25%
- Feature development complexity: 30-60% increase

### Technology Debt
- Security vulnerability risk: High
- Maintenance cost: 40-80% increase
- Talent acquisition difficulty: Significant
