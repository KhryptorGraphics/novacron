# API Validation Checklist

## Overview
This checklist validates API endpoints, performance, and integration readiness for the NovaCron platform.

## Required Artifacts
- API documentation
- Endpoint tests and results
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling documentation
- Integration test results

## Validation Criteria

### Section 1: API Design & Documentation (Weight: 20%)

**Instructions**: Evaluate API design patterns, documentation completeness, and RESTful compliance.

#### 1.1 API Design Standards
- [ ] RESTful endpoints follow standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Consistent URL patterns and naming conventions
- [ ] Proper HTTP status code usage (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- [ ] Content negotiation support (JSON, XML where needed)
- [ ] API versioning strategy implemented

#### 1.2 Documentation Quality  
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation available
- [ ] All endpoints documented with request/response schemas
- [ ] Authentication and authorization documented
- [ ] Error response formats documented
- [ ] Rate limiting policies documented

### Section 2: Endpoint Functionality (Weight: 25%)

**Instructions**: Validate core API endpoints for functionality and data integrity.

#### 2.1 Core API Endpoints
- [ ] VM management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization endpoints
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics endpoints
- [ ] Configuration management endpoints
- [ ] Health check and status endpoints

#### 2.2 Data Validation
- [ ] Input validation on all POST/PUT endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid data
- [ ] Data sanitization implemented
- [ ] Required field validation
- [ ] Data type validation and conversion

### Section 3: Security & Authentication (Weight: 20%)

**Instructions**: Validate security measures and authentication mechanisms.

#### 3.1 Authentication
- [ ] JWT token authentication implemented
- [ ] Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] OAuth2 integration where applicable
- [ ] Session management security

#### 3.2 Authorization & Access Control
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- [ ] Endpoint-level permission validation
- [ ] Resource-level access control
- [ ] API key management for service accounts
- [ ] Audit logging for security events

### Section 4: Performance & Scalability (Weight: 20%)

**Instructions**: Validate API performance under load and scalability measures.

#### 4.1 Response Time Performance
- [ ] Average response time < 200ms for read operations
- [ ] Average response time < 500ms for write operations
- [ ] P95 response time within acceptable limits
- [ ] Database query optimization implemented
- [ ] Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

#### 4.2 Scalability & Load Handling
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- [ ] Connection pooling and resource management
- [ ] Horizontal scaling capability demonstrated
- [ ] Load balancer integration tested
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies

### Section 5: Error Handling & Resilience (Weight: 15%)

**Instructions**: Validate error handling, logging, and system resilience.

#### 5.1 Error Management
- [ ] Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- [ ] Meaningful error messages for client debugging
- [ ] Proper error categorization and status codes
- [ ] Error logging without sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Graceful degradation under failure conditions

#### 5.2 Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Request/response logging implemented
- [ ] Performance metrics collection (response time, throughput)
- [ ] Error rate monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Distributed tracing for complex operations
- [ ] Health check endpoints for monitoring systems

## Scoring Guidelines

**Pass Criteria**: Item clearly meets requirement with evidence
**Fail Criteria**: Item not implemented or insufficient coverage
**Partial Criteria**: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
**N/A Criteria**: Not applicable to current system design

## Final Assessment Instructions

Calculate pass rate by section:
- Section 1 (API Design): __/10 items × 20% = __% 
- Section 2 (Functionality): __/10 items × 25% = __%
- Section 3 (Security): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 4 (Performance): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 5 (Error Handling): __/10 items × 15% = __%

**Overall API Validation Score**: __/100%
