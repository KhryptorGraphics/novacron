## Scoring Guidelines

**Pass Criteria**: Performance metric meets or exceeds SLA requirements
**Fail Criteria**: Performance metric significantly below requirements
**Partial Criteria**: Performance acceptable but improvement needed
**N/A Criteria**: Metric not applicable to current system design

## Final Assessment Instructions

Calculate pass rate by section:
- Section 1 (Response Time): __/10 items × 25% = __% 
- Section 2 (Throughput): __/10 items × 25% = __%
- Section 3 (Resource Usage): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 4 (Database): __/10 items × 15% = __%
- Section 5 (Monitoring): __/10 items × 15% = __%

**Overall Performance Validation Score**: __/100%

## SLA Requirements Reference

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| API Response Time (P50) | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| API Response Time (P95) | < 500ms | < 1000ms |
| Page Load Time | < 3s | < 5s |
| Throughput | > 1000 req/s | > 500 req/s |
| Uptime | > 99.9% | > 99% |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | < 1% |
