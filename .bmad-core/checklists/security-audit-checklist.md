- [ ] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- [ ] API security controls and rate limiting

### Section 5: Security Monitoring & Incident Response (Weight: 15%)

**Instructions**: Validate security monitoring capabilities and incident response procedures.

#### 5.1 Security Monitoring
- [ ] Security information and event management (SIEM)
- [ ] Real-time threat detection and alerting
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Behavioral analytics and anomaly detection
- [ ] Security metrics and reporting

#### 5.2 Incident Response
- [ ] Incident response plan documented and tested
- [ ] Security incident classification procedures
- [ ] Forensic investigation capabilities
- [ ] Breach notification procedures
- [ ] Recovery and business continuity plans

## Scoring Guidelines

**Pass Criteria**: Security control implemented and validated with evidence
**Fail Criteria**: Security control missing or inadequate
**Partial Criteria**: Security control implemented but needs improvement
**N/A Criteria**: Security control not applicable to current system

## Final Assessment Instructions

Calculate pass rate by section:
- Section 1 (Authentication): __/10 items × 25% = __% 
- Section 2 (Data Protection): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 3 (Network Security): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 4 (Application Security): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 5 (Monitoring): __/10 items × 15% = __%

**Overall Security Audit Score**: __/100%

## Compliance Framework Mapping

| Control | NIST CSF | ISO 27001 | SOC 2 | GDPR |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|------|
| Authentication | PR.AC-1 | A.9.2.1 | CC6.1 | Art. 32 |
| Encryption | PR.DS-1 | A.10.1.1 | CC6.1 | Art. 32 |
| Access Control | PR.AC-4 | A.9.1.2 | CC6.2 | Art. 25 |
| Monitoring | DE.CM-1 | A.12.4.1 | CC7.2 | Art. 33 |
| Incident Response | RS.RP-1 | A.16.1.1 | CC7.4 | Art. 34 |

## Vulnerability Risk Ratings

| Rating | CVSS Score | Response Time | Remediation SLA |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Immediate | 24 hours |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | 24 hours | 7 days |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | 7 days | 30 days |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | 30 days | 90 days |
