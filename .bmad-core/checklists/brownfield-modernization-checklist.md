## Scoring Guidelines

**Pass Criteria**: Modernization aspect successfully implemented with evidence
**Fail Criteria**: Legacy approach still in use or modernization incomplete
**Partial Criteria**: Modernization in progress but not complete
**N/A Criteria**: Not applicable to current modernization scope

## Final Assessment Instructions

Calculate pass rate by section:
- Section 1 (Legacy Analysis): __/10 items × 20% = __% 
- Section 2 (Architecture): __/10 items × 25% = __%
- Section 3 (Data Migration): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 4 (Integration): __/10 items × 20% = __%
- Section 5 (Migration Execution): __/10 items × 15% = __%

**Overall Brownfield Modernization Score**: __/100%
