2. ✅ Missing strings import in core/security/example_integration.go  
3. ✅ Undefined api.Bool in core/security/vault.go (changed to pointer)
4. ✅ Removed unused encoding/json import from core/security/vault.go
5. ✅ Removed unused strconv import from api/admin/database.go
6. ✅ Removed unused encoding/json from core/migration/monitor.go
7. ✅ Removed unused encoding/binary and io from core/migration/orchestrator.go
8. ✅ Removed unused io from core/migration/rollback.go

## Remaining Issues:
- External dependency issues in cached modules
- Need to focus on local codebase compilation
- createConfigBackup assignment mismatch (may be in external dependency)
