- Create contextual anomaly detection considering workload patterns
- Design alert prioritization based on business impact

### Failure Prediction
- Use gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) for high accuracy
- Implement survival analysis for time-to-failure estimation
- Create feature importance analysis for maintenance insights
- Design cost-sensitive learning to balance false positives/negatives

### Reinforcement Learning for VM Placement
- Implement deep Q-networks with experience replay
