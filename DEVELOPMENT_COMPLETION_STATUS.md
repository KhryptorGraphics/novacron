- **Docker development environment** (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)
- **Automated dependency management** and health checks
- **Process management** with graceful shutdown

#### 3. Production-Ready Features
- **Complete monitoring dashboard** with real-time updates
- **Advanced visualizations**: heatmaps, network topology, predictive charts
- **Alert management system** with acknowledgment capabilities
- **VM lifecycle management** with templates and cloning
- **Storage and network management**

#### 4. Documentation & Deployment
- **Comprehensive README** with quick start guide
- **Updated project structure** documentation
- **Clear next steps** and development roadmap
- **API endpoint documentation**

## 🚀 How to Start Development

### Quick Start (Choose your platform):

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 weeks)

### 1. Test the Current Implementation
```bash
# Start the development environment
.\start_development.ps1  # or ./start_development.sh

# Test the API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/monitoring/metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/monitoring/vms

# Access the dashboard
# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### 2. Fix Any Integration Issues
- Run `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies
- Test frontend-backend communication
- Verify WebSocket connections
- Check KVM integration (if available)

### 3. Production Deployment Preparation
- Review Docker configurations
- Set up environment variables
- Configure production settings
- Test deployment scripts
