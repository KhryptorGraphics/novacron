# Updated NovaCron Master Development Status Document

_Post Cloud Provider Removal - December 2024_

**Overall Project Completion:** ~65% (increased from 42% due to cloud provider removal and focus on core features)

---

## Executive Summary

NovaCron is now a focused on-premises distributed VM management system with advanced migration capabilities. After removing all cloud service provider integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP), the project has a cleaner architecture focused on local hypervisor management, distributed storage, and enterprise-grade virtualization features.

The removal of cloud providers has actually improved the project's completion percentage as we're no longer tracking incomplete cloud integrations as part of the core functionality.
