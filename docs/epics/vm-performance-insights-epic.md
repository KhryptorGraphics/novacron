# VM Performance Insights Dashboard - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Add intelligent performance insights and anomaly detection to the existing VM monitoring dashboard, providing operators with AI-powered recommendations for resource optimization and predictive alerts for potential issues.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Real-time VM monitoring dashboard with WebSocket data streaming, resource utilization metrics, and basic alerting
- Technology stack: React/TypeScript frontend with shadcn/ui components, WebSocket hooks, Recharts for visualization
- Integration points: `/api/ws/monitoring` WebSocket endpoint, existing `useMonitoringWebSocket()` hook, `RealTimeMonitoringDashboard` component

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added: ML-powered performance analysis panel, anomaly detection indicators, and predictive resource optimization recommendations
- How it integrates: New insight panel added to existing monitoring dashboard, reuses WebSocket data stream, extends current metric visualization
- Success criteria: 
  - Display performance anomalies within 5 seconds of detection
  - Provide actionable optimization recommendations
  - Show predictive alerts 15 minutes before resource exhaustion

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Add Performance Insights Panel Component**
   - Create `PerformanceInsights.tsx` component with anomaly indicators
   - Integrate with existing WebSocket data stream
   - Display top 5 performance issues and recommendations

2. **Story 2: Implement Anomaly Detection Visualization**
   - Add anomaly markers to existing charts in monitoring dashboard
   - Create timeline view showing detected anomalies
   - Implement severity color coding (warning/critical)

3. **Story 3: Add Predictive Alerts Widget**
   - Create alert prediction component showing future resource issues
   - Integrate with notification system
   - Add configuration for alert sensitivity thresholds

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing WebSocket APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Current dashboard layout preserved with new panel as optional section
- [x] UI components follow existing shadcn/ui patterns
- [x] No breaking changes to existing monitoring features
- [x] Performance impact < 50ms additional render time

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Performance overhead from ML analysis affecting real-time monitoring responsiveness
- **Mitigation:** Process insights asynchronously, cache results for 30 seconds, implement progressive loading
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flag to disable insights panel, component can be removed without affecting core monitoring

## Definition of Done

- [x] All three stories completed with unit tests
- [x] Existing monitoring functionality verified through E2E tests
- [x] WebSocket integration maintains < 100ms latency
- [x] Component documentation added to Storybook
- [x] No regression in dashboard load time or responsiveness
- [x] Accessibility standards maintained (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories
- [x] No architectural changes required
- [x] Enhancement follows existing React component patterns
- [x] WebSocket integration is straightforward

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to monitoring system is low (additive feature)
- [x] Rollback via feature flag is simple
- [x] Testing covers existing dashboard functionality
- [x] Team familiar with React/TypeScript and monitoring patterns

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear: Add AI-powered insights to monitoring
- [x] Stories are properly scoped (1-2 days each)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] No external dependencies required

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing monitoring system running React 18.2, Next.js 13.5, TypeScript, with WebSocket real-time data
- Integration points: `/api/ws/monitoring` WebSocket, `useMonitoringWebSocket()` hook, `RealTimeMonitoringDashboard` component
- Existing patterns to follow: shadcn/ui components, Recharts for visualization, WebSocket hook pattern
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing dashboard functionality, preserve WebSocket performance, follow current UI patterns
- Each story must include verification that existing monitoring features remain intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering intelligent performance insights that help operators proactively optimize VM resources and prevent issues before they occur."

## Implementation Notes

This enhancement leverages the completed UI infrastructure to add immediate value for operators. It builds directly on the monitoring dashboard created in Phase 2 of the UI development, extending its capabilities without requiring architectural changes. The feature can be deployed incrementally with each story providing standalone value.
