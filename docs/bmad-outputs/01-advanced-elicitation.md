2. **Federation System** 
   - Focus: Cross-cluster coordination, consistency guarantees
   - Visual Elements: Network topology diagrams, consensus flows
   - Scope Options: Local cluster vs. global federation features

3. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Focus: Data integrity, RTO/RPO compliance
   - Visual Elements: Backup schedules, restore procedures
   - Scope Options: Point-in-time recovery vs. disaster recovery

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Focus: SLA compliance, proactive alerting
   - Visual Elements: Dashboard layouts, alert flow diagrams
   - Scope Options: System metrics vs. business metrics

## Advanced Elicitation Options

Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:

0. **Expand or Contract for Audience** - Adjust technical depth and detail level
1. **Critique and Refine** - Identify improvements and optimization opportunities  
2. **Identify Potential Risks** - Uncover hidden risks and failure modes
3. **Assess Alignment with Goals** - Validate against strategic objectives
4. **Tree of Thoughts** - Explore multiple architectural approaches
5. **ReWOO Analysis** - Systematic decomposition without assumptions
6. **Meta-Prompting** - Self-improving system design patterns
7. **Innovation Tournament** - Compete alternative technical solutions
8. **Red Team vs Blue Team** - Attack/defense security analysis
9. Proceed / No Further Actions

## Method Execution Examples

### Example: Critique and Refine (Option 1)

**Architecture Critique:**
- Current microservices approach may benefit from service mesh integration
- Database sharding strategy needs review for horizontal scaling
- API versioning strategy should include backward compatibility guarantees

**Performance Refinements:**
- Caching layer optimization for frequently accessed VM metadata
- Asynchronous processing patterns for long-running operations
- Connection pooling and circuit breaker implementations

**Security Enhancements:**
- Zero-trust network architecture implementation
- Enhanced audit logging for compliance requirements
- Secret rotation automation and key management

### Example: Innovation Tournament (Option 7)

**VM Lifecycle Management Approaches:**

**Contestant 1: Event-Driven Architecture**
- Pros: Loose coupling, scalable, audit trail
- Cons: Complexity, eventual consistency challenges
- Score: 8/10 for scalability, 6/10 for simplicity

**Contestant 2: State Machine Orchestration**
- Pros: Clear state transitions, error handling, deterministic
- Cons: Central coordination point, less flexible
- Score: 7/10 for reliability, 8/10 for clarity

**Contestant 3: Actor Model Pattern**
- Pros: Natural concurrency, fault isolation, location transparency
- Cons: Learning curve, debugging complexity
- Score: 9/10 for concurrency, 5/10 for adoption

## Actionable Insights Generated

1. **Requirement Gaps Identified**
   - Multi-tenancy isolation requirements need clarification
   - Disaster recovery RTO/RPO specifications missing
   - Performance benchmarks for different workload types needed

2. **Stakeholder Alignment Opportunities**
