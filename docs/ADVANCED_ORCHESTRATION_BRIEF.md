# Advanced VM Orchestration Features - Requirements Brief

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements and specifications for implementing advanced orchestration capabilities in NovaCron, transforming it from a VM management platform into an intelligent, self-managing orchestration system.

## Vision Statement

Enable NovaCron to autonomously optimize, scale, and heal virtualized infrastructure while maintaining operator control and visibility, reducing operational overhead by 40% and improving resource efficiency by 25%.

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Workload Placement Engine

**Objective**: Optimize VM placement across the infrastructure considering multiple constraints and objectives.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Multi-dimensional constraint solving (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- Affinity/anti-affinity rule enforcement
- Topology-aware scheduling (NUMA, rack awareness)
- Cost-optimized placement strategies

**Technical Requirements**:
```go
type PlacementRequest struct {
    VM           VMSpec
    Constraints  []Constraint
    Preferences  []Preference
    Strategy     PlacementStrategy
}

type PlacementDecision struct {
    TargetNode   string
    Score        float64
    Explanation  string
    Alternatives []Alternative
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 30% improvement in resource utilization
- <100ms placement decision time
- 95% first-placement success rate

### 2. Predictive Auto-Scaling System

**Objective**: Anticipate resource demands and scale proactively before performance degradation.

**Key Capabilities**:

  Ensemble:
    - Weighted voting based on historical accuracy
    - Confidence intervals for uncertainty
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 80% prediction accuracy within 10% margin
- 50% reduction in reactive scaling events

  Level1_Quick:
    - RestartService: <30 seconds
    - RestartVM: <2 minutes
  
  Level2_Migrate:
    - LiveMigration: <5 minutes

    - DisasterRecovery: <15 minutes
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 99.95% availability SLA
- <5 minute MTTR for known failures
- 90% autonomous recovery success rate

### 4. Multi-Cloud Orchestration (Phase 2)

**Objective**: Seamlessly orchestrate workloads across on-premise and multiple cloud providers.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Unified orchestration API
- Cloud-agnostic workload definitions
- Cross-cloud migration capabilities
- Cost arbitrage optimization

### 5. Policy-Driven Automation

**Objective**: Enable declarative orchestration through policy definitions.

**Policy Examples**:
```yaml
policies:
  - name: production-sla
    selector:
      tags: ["production"]
    rules:
      - minReplicas: 3
      - antiAffinity: hard
      - autoScaling: aggressive
      - healingPriority: immediate
  
  - name: cost-optimization
    selector:
      tags: ["development"]
    rules:
      - spotInstances: true
      - scaleDownDelay: 5m
      - consolidation: aggressive
```
