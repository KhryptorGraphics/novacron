# SSL/TLS Termination Setup - Brownfield Addition

## Story Title

Production SSL/TLS Termination - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a security-conscious IT administrator,
I want SSL/TLS termination properly configured for all NovaCron endpoints,
So that all communication is encrypted and meets enterprise security requirements.

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with**: Gorilla WebSocket server, REST API endpoints, Grafana/Prometheus
- **Technology**: Go 1.23.0 with `gorilla/mux`, existing nginx reverse proxy setup
- **Follows pattern**: Existing middleware chain in `backend/pkg/middleware/`
- **Touch points**: 
  - `backend/cmd/api-server/main.go` - server initialization
  - `docker-compose.yml` - nginx configuration
  - `deployment/kubernetes/` - ingress controllers

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. SSL/TLS 1.3 enabled on all HTTP endpoints (port 8090)
2. WebSocket secure (WSS) enabled on port 8091
3. Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect configured

### Integration Requirements

4. Existing REST API endpoints continue to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing nginx configuration pattern
6. Integration with monitoring endpoints maintains current behavior

### Quality Requirements

7. Change is covered by SSL verification tests
8. Documentation updated in deployment guide
9. No regression in API response times verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add TLS configuration to existing server setup, update nginx proxy_pass
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: See `deployment/docker/nginx.conf` for current proxy configuration
- **Key Constraints**: Must support both development (self-signed) and production (Let's Encrypt) certificates

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met (TLS 1.3 on all endpoints)
- [x] Integration requirements verified (API compatibility maintained)
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing middleware patterns
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new SSL verification)
- [x] Documentation updated in deployment guides

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment

- **Primary Risk**: Certificate management complexity in multi-environment setup
- **Mitigation**: Use environment-based certificate loading with clear defaults
- **Rollback**: Feature flag `TLS_ENABLED` to disable if issues arise

### Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to existing REST APIs
- [x] WebSocket upgrade mechanism preserved
- [x] Monitoring endpoints remain accessible
- [x] Performance impact negligible (<2% latency increase)
