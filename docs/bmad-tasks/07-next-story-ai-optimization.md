## Priority
High (P1)

## Story Points
13 (Complex - ML integration with real-time systems)

## User Story

**As a** DevOps Engineer managing large-scale VM infrastructure,  
**I want** AI-powered recommendations for resource allocation,  
**So that** I can reduce infrastructure costs by 45% while maintaining performance SLAs.

## Background

Current manual resource allocation leads to:
- 35% average resource underutilization
- $2.3M annual overspend on cloud resources
- 18% of VMs over-provisioned, 12% under-provisioned
- Manual intervention required for 67% of scaling events

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **ML Model Integration**
   - [ ] LSTM model predicts resource usage 24 hours ahead with >85% accuracy
   - [ ] Prophet model handles seasonal workload patterns
   - [ ] Ensemble approach combines multiple predictions
   - [ ] Model retraining occurs weekly with new data

2. **Real-time Analysis**
   - [ ] Analyzes metrics from 100+ VMs every 60 seconds
   - [ ] Identifies optimization opportunities within 5 minutes
   - [ ] Generates actionable recommendations with confidence scores
   - [ ] Provides cost-benefit analysis for each recommendation

3. **Automated Actions**
   - [ ] Auto-scales VMs based on predictions (opt-in)
   - [ ] Migrates workloads to optimize resource pools
   - [ ] Schedules maintenance during predicted low-usage periods
   - [ ] Implements approved changes with rollback capability

4. **Dashboard & Reporting**
   - [ ] Real-time optimization dashboard shows potential savings
   - [ ] Weekly reports demonstrate actual cost reductions
   - [ ] Alert system for anomalous resource patterns
   - [ ] Historical analysis shows optimization trends

### Non-Functional Requirements

5. **Performance**
   - [ ] Predictions generated in <500ms per VM
   - [ ] Dashboard updates within 2 seconds
   - [ ] Handles 10,000 VMs without degradation
   - [ ] <2% CPU overhead on monitoring infrastructure

6. **Reliability**
   - [ ] 99.9% uptime for optimization service
   - [ ] Graceful degradation if ML models unavailable
   - [ ] Automatic fallback to rule-based recommendations
   - [ ] No impact on VM operations if service fails

7. **Security & Compliance**
   - [ ] All recommendations logged for audit
   - [ ] Role-based access to optimization controls
   - [ ] Encryption of sensitive resource data
   - [ ] Compliance with data retention policies
