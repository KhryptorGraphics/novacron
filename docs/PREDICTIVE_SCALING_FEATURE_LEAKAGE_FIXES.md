# Predictive Scaling Feature Leakage Fixes

## Summary

Fixed feature leakage issues in the LSTM prediction pipeline in `/ai_engine/predictive_scaling.py` where `datetime.now()` was being used during prediction generation, causing the model to access future information not available in real-world scenarios.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. LSTM Prediction Feature Leakage (Lines 447-454)

**Problem**: The `_predict_lstm()` method was using `datetime.now()` to generate cyclical time features for future predictions, creating feature leakage.

**Fix**: Modified `_predict_lstm()` to accept a `last_timestamp` parameter and step forward from the last known historical timestamp:

```python
# Before (feature leakage):
ts = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=len(predictions)+1)

# After (fixed):
ts = last_timestamp + timedelta(minutes=step+1)
```

### 2. Main Prediction Method (Line 311)

**Problem**: Main prediction method needed to pass the last timestamp from historical data to LSTM predictor.

**Fix**: Extract last timestamp from historical data and pass it to LSTM:

```python
# Get the last timestamp from historical data to avoid feature leakage
last_timestamp = pd.to_datetime(historical_data['timestamp']).iloc[-1]

# Pass to LSTM predictor
pred, conf = self._predict_lstm(model, features, last_timestamp)
```

### 3. ResourceForecast Timestamp Calculation (Lines 395-397)

**Problem**: Peak and valley times were calculated using historical timestamps but numpy indices caused type errors.

**Fix**: Convert numpy indices to int before using with timedelta:

```python
peak_time=last_timestamp + timedelta(minutes=int(peak_idx))
valley_time=last_timestamp + timedelta(minutes=int(valley_idx))
```

### 4. Fallback Forecast Method (Lines 632-634)

**Problem**: Fallback forecasts also used current time instead of historical timestamps.

**Fix**: Use last timestamp from historical data when available:

```python
# Get the last timestamp from historical data, or use current time if no data
if len(data) > 0 and 'timestamp' in data.columns:
    last_timestamp = pd.to_datetime(data['timestamp']).iloc[-1]
else:
    last_timestamp = datetime.now()  # Only when no historical data exists
```

## Impact of Fixes

### Before Fixes:
- LSTM predictions used current datetime for cyclical features
- Future information could leak into predictions
- Predictions were not reproducible for the same historical data
- Model could inadvertently learn from future patterns

### After Fixes:
- All predictions use only historical data timestamps
- No future information is accessed during prediction
- Predictions are based purely on past data patterns
- Cyclical time features correctly step forward from last known timestamp

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `/tests/test_predictive_scaling_fixes.py` to verify:

1. **No datetime.now() in LSTM predictions**: Verifies LSTM uses historical timestamps
2. **Forecast uses historical timestamps**: Ensures forecasts are based on historical data timeline
3. **Feature preparation integrity**: Confirms features are derived from historical data only
4. **Fallback forecast correctness**: Tests fallback scenarios use proper timestamps
5. **Prediction consistency**: Ensures reproducible predictions with same historical data
6. **Empty data handling**: Validates graceful fallback when no data available

All tests pass, confirming the feature leakage has been eliminated.

## Files Modified

1. `/ai_engine/predictive_scaling.py`:
   - Modified `predict_resource_demand()` method
   - Fixed `_predict_lstm()` method signature and implementation
   - Updated `_generate_fallback_forecast()` method
   - Fixed numpy index type conversion issues

2. `/tests/test_predictive_scaling_fixes.py`:
   - New comprehensive test suite
   - Covers all prediction scenarios
   - Validates timestamp handling correctness

## Key Improvements

✅ **Eliminated Feature Leakage**: No future information used in predictions
✅ **Temporal Consistency**: All forecasts properly sequenced from historical data
✅ **Reproducibility**: Same historical data produces consistent predictions
✅ **Type Safety**: Fixed numpy int64 to int conversion for timedelta
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for timestamp handling
✅ **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintained existing API and functionality

The predictive scaling engine now generates forecasts using only past information, making it suitable for production use where future data is not available.
