risk_level: MEDIUM

summary: |
  Multi-provider secrets management system with caching shows solid architecture
  but has security concerns that should be addressed before production deployment.

concerns:
  critical:
    - id: SEC-001
      issue: "Hardcoded default Vault address (localhost:8200) could leak in production"
      impact: HIGH
      recommendation: "Use config file or require explicit configuration"
      
    - id: SEC-002
      issue: "No secret rotation mechanism implemented"
      impact: HIGH
      recommendation: "Implement automatic rotation with versioning support"
      
  high:
    - id: SEC-003
      issue: "Cache TTL is hardcoded (5 minutes) without configuration"
      impact: MEDIUM
      recommendation: "Make TTL configurable per secret type"
      
    - id: SEC-004
      issue: "No audit logging for secret access"
      impact: HIGH
      recommendation: "Add audit trail for all secret operations"
      
    - id: SEC-005
      issue: "EnvProvider stores secrets in memory without encryption"
      impact: MEDIUM
      recommendation: "Encrypt in-memory secrets or document security implications"

  medium:
    - id: TEST-001
      issue: "No unit tests for secrets manager"
      impact: MEDIUM
      recommendation: "Add comprehensive test coverage with mocked providers"
      
    - id: ERR-001
      issue: "Error handling doesn't distinguish between not found vs access denied"
      impact: MEDIUM
      recommendation: "Implement specific error types for different failure modes"

positive_findings:
  - "Clean provider abstraction allows easy extension"
  - "Proper mutex usage for thread-safe caching"
  - "Support for multiple providers (Vault, AWS, Env)"
  - "Cache invalidation on updates/deletes"
  - "Context support for all operations"

test_coverage:
  unit_tests: NOT_FOUND
  integration_tests: NOT_FOUND
  security_tests: NOT_FOUND
  estimated_coverage: 0%

requirements_traceability:

  security:
    score: 6/10

  reliability:
    score: 7/10
    issues: ["No retry logic", "No circuit breaker"]
  maintainability:
    score: 9/10
    notes: "Clean abstractions, good separation"

recommended_actions:
  must_fix:
    - "Add audit logging for compliance"
    - "Implement secret rotation mechanism"
    - "Remove hardcoded Vault address default"
  should_fix:
    - "Add comprehensive test suite"
    - "Make cache TTL configurable"
    - "Implement retry logic with backoff"
  nice_to_have:
    - "Add metrics collection"
    - "Implement circuit breaker pattern"
    - "Add secret versioning support"

decision_rationale: |
  While the implementation shows good architectural patterns and clean abstractions,
  critical security features are missing for production use. The lack of audit logging
  and secret rotation pose compliance risks. These issues should be addressed before
  production deployment, though the system could be used in development/staging with
  documented limitations.

waiver_conditions:
  - "Document security limitations clearly"
  - "Use only in non-production environments"
  - "Implement monitoring for secret access patterns"
  - "Plan for security enhancements in next sprint"
