gate_decision: PASS
confidence: 88%
risk_level: LOW

summary: |
  Significant test coverage improvement from 60% to 80%+ with comprehensive
  unit tests, mocks, and concurrent operation testing.

positive_findings:
  - "Coverage increased from 60% to 80%+"
  - "Comprehensive mock implementations"
  - "Concurrent operation testing"
  - "Error scenario coverage"
  - "CRUD operation validation"
  - "Table-driven test approach"
  - "Proper test isolation with mocks"

concerns:
  medium:
    - id: TEST-001
      issue: "Integration tests not visible"
      impact: MEDIUM
      recommendation: "Add E2E integration test suite"
      
    - id: TEST-002
      issue: "No performance/load testing"
      impact: MEDIUM
      recommendation: "Add performance benchmarks"
