gate_decision: PASS
confidence: 92%
risk_level: LOW

summary: |
  Well-structured error handling system with comprehensive error codes,
  proper error wrapping, and HTTP status mapping. Minor improvements recommended.

positive_findings:
  - "Structured error codes with clear categorization"
  - "Proper error unwrapping support (Go 1.13+)"
  - "Request ID and User ID tracking for debugging"
  - "Stack trace capture capability"
  - "JSON marshaling for API responses"
  - "HTTP status code mapping"
  - "Timestamp tracking for all errors"
  - "Metadata support for additional context"

concerns:
  low:
    - id: TEST-001
      issue: "No visible test coverage for error types"
      impact: LOW
      recommendation: "Add unit tests for error creation and marshaling"
      
    - id: DOC-001
      issue: "Missing godoc comments for exported types"
      impact: LOW
      recommendation: "Add comprehensive documentation"

    notes: "Consistent error handling across application"
  maintainability:
    score: 8/10
    notes: "Clear structure, could use more documentation"

recommended_actions:
  nice_to_have:
    - "Add unit tests for error handling"
    - "Add godoc documentation"
    - "Consider error code registry for validation"
    - "Add error metrics collection hook"

decision_rationale: |
  Excellent error handling implementation that follows Go best practices.
  The system provides comprehensive error tracking, proper error wrapping,
  and clean API error responses. Ready for production use.
