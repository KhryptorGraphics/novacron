## üö® Critical Deployment Blockers

### Priority 1 - Backend Compilation Failure
**Impact**: Complete backend service unavailable  
**Root Cause**: Import path inconsistencies preventing compilation
**Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
**Status**: **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKING**

```bash
Error: backend/api/rest/handlers.go compilation failed
Fix: Standardize import paths across all backend modules
```

### Priority 2 - Frontend Runtime Crashes  
**Impact**: All frontend pages unusable
**Root Cause**: Null pointer exceptions during pre-rendering
**Fix Time**: 4-6 hours
**Status**: **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKING**

```javascript
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
Location: All frontend pages (19/19 affected)
```

### Priority 3 - Health Check Validation
**Impact**: Cannot validate service health for deployment  
**Root Cause**: Application services cannot start for validation
**Fix Time**: 1 hour (after compilation fixes)
**Status**: **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKING**
