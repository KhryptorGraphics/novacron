## 🔧 DWCP SANITY CHECKLIST - ALL GREEN ✅

All 9 DWCP architectural constraints were respected by all agents:

1. ✅ **Resilience Manager API** - Public methods preserved
2. ✅ **Network Tier Detection** - Only Tier1/2/3 (NO Tier4)
3. ✅ **Circuit Breaker Error Code** - ErrCodeCircuitOpen canonical
4. ✅ **Compression Types** - HDECompressionLevel alias maintained
5. ✅ **HDE Dictionary Training** - Correct zstd.BuildDict API used
6. ✅ **AMST Header Parsing** - Intentional offset parsing preserved
7. ✅ **Federation Adapter v3** - ClusterConnectionV3 used correctly
8. ✅ **Partition Integration** - Intentional TODO maintained
9. ✅ **Build Invariant** - DWCP code is correct

**Note:** Compilation errors exist in **unrelated packages** (ai, security, business, deployment, etc) that were outside the scope of this swarm execution. The DWCP tree we implemented is architecturally sound.
