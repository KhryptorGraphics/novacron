## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks & Mitigation

1. **Repository Cleanup Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Data loss during merge conflict resolution
   - **Mitigation:** Backup branch, manual review, automated validation

2. **Initialization Performance**
   - **Risk:** Boot time target (15-25s) not met
   - **Mitigation:** Continuous benchmarking, critical path optimization

3. **ML Model Accuracy**
   - **Risk:** PBA/ITP predictions below 85% accuracy
   - **Mitigation:** A/B testing, rule-based fallback, continuous retraining

4. **Multi-Region Latency**
   - **Risk:** Cross-region sync >5 seconds
   - **Mitigation:** Regional caching, adaptive staleness, predictive prefetching

5. **Multi-Cloud Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Integration delays with AWS/Azure/GCP
   - **Mitigation:** Start with 2 clouds, phased rollout, extensive testing
