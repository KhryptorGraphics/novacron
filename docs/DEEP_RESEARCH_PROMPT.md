# NovaCron Deep Technical Research & Completion Prompt

## Research Objective

Complete the NovaCron distributed VM management platform by identifying and resolving all integration gaps, implementing missing features, and achieving production readiness through systematic validation and advanced development workflows.

## Background Context

NovaCron is an 85% complete distributed VM management platform with:
- **Backend**: Go microservices with libvirt, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13.5 with React 18.2, TypeScript, WebSockets
- **Current State**: Core functionality complete, UI/UX enhanced, 47 critical issues identified
- **Technical Debt**: 120-160 hours estimated for completion

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **Integration Architecture**
   - Which API endpoints are actually called by the frontend but not implemented?
   - What is the correct WebSocket message contract between frontend and backend?
   - How should the authentication flow work end-to-end?

2. **Feature Completeness**
   - Which VM operations are critical for MVP vs nice-to-have?
   - What storage operations must be functional for basic operation?
   - Which monitoring features are essential vs advanced?

3. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Can we implement a basic scheduler without full Kubernetes integration?
   - Should we use mock implementations or real hypervisor integration for MVP?
   - What's the minimum viable authentication/RBAC implementation?

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - What are the security implications of the current WebSocket bypass?
   - Which missing implementations block critical user workflows?
   - What are the deployment blockers that must be resolved?

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

1. How can we leverage the completed UI to drive backend implementation priorities?
2. Which third-party integrations can be deferred post-MVP?
3. What performance optimizations can wait for v2?
