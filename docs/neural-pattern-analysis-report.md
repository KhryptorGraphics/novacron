## Appendix: Pattern Recognition Algorithms

### Pattern Scoring Formula
```
Pattern_Score = Σ(weight_i × metric_i) / n
where:
  weight_i = learned weight for metric i
  metric_i = normalized metric value (0-1)
  n = number of metrics
```

### Anti-pattern Detection
```
Is_Anti_pattern = (
  (Security_Score < 0.3) OR
  (Performance_Impact < -0.5) OR
  (Maintainability_Score < 0.4) OR
  (Pattern_Name contains 'vuln_' OR 'anti_')
)
```

### Model Training Algorithm
```
for epoch in range(100):
    for batch in training_data:
        predictions = model.forward(batch.features)
        loss = calculate_loss(predictions, batch.labels)
        gradients = loss.backward()
        optimizer.step(gradients)
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            accuracy = evaluate(model, validation_data)
            logger.info(f"Epoch {epoch}: Accuracy = {accuracy}")
```
