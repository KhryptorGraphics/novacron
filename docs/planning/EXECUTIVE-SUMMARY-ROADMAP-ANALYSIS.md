- **Action Required:** Complete by November 15 (this week)
- **Escalation:** If not complete by November 13, assign additional resources

### 2. Beads Issue Tracking Incomplete ⚠️
- **Status:** Only 6 open issues, 20-30 roadmap tasks not tracked
- **Impact:** Poor visibility, coordination challenges
- **Action Required:** Create all issues by November 12
- **Owner:** Planning agent

### 3. Repository Not Clean ⚠️
- **Status:** 218 untracked files, merge conflicts in .beads/ files
- **Impact:** Deployment pipeline blocked, version control issues
- **Action Required:** Begin cleanup immediately (no blocker)
- **Owner:** Reviewer, system-architect

## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks
1. **Phase 0 Benchmark Delay** - HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact ⚠️
2. **DWCP Phases Blocked** - HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact (caused by #1) ⚠️

### High Priority Risks
3. **Beads Tracking Incomplete** - MEDIUM likelihood, MEDIUM impact ⚠️
4. **Repository Not Clean** - MEDIUM likelihood, MEDIUM impact ⚠️

### Overall Risk Level: ⚠️ MODERATE
**Target:** LOW (achievable by addressing benchmarks and tracking)

### Risk Mitigation
- All critical risks have documented mitigation strategies
- Fallback plans in place (ML models → rule-based, multi-cloud → 2 clouds first)
- Continuous monitoring and weekly risk reviews planned
- Escalation process defined for blockers

---

## Resource Requirements

### Team (Approved)
- **5 Full-Time:** Backend dev, architect, ML dev, DevOps, QA
- **3 Part-Time:** Security (50%), Performance (50%), Docs (25%)
- **35+ Swarm Agents:** On-demand via Claude Flow (98-99% accuracy)

**Potential Gap:** May need 2nd backend developer for parallel execution

### Infrastructure (Requires Budget Adjustment)
- **Budgeted:** $8,000/month
- **Actual Need:** $9,800/month
- **Shortfall:** $1,800/month (18% underestimate)
- **Recommendation:** Adjust budget to $10K/month ($16K total increase)

### Total Budget
- **Original:** $176,000
- **Recommended:** $192,000 (still 9.9:1 ROI)
