### MEDDPICC Application to DWCP Sales

#### **Metrics (M)**
**Objective:** Quantify the business value of DWCP in financial terms

**Key Metrics to Establish:**
1. **Cost Savings** - "How much are you spending on VMware licensing annually?"
   - Target: 60-80% reduction
   - Example: $4.2M → $850K annual licensing = $3.35M savings

2. **Performance Improvement** - "What's the business impact of faster AI/ML training?"
   - Target: 10-100x faster processing
   - Example: 8-hour model training → 10 minutes = 47x improvement

3. **Infrastructure Reduction** - "How many servers could you eliminate with 10x performance?"
   - Target: 40-60% server reduction
   - Example: 500 servers → 250 servers = $2.5M hardware savings

4. **Time to Market** - "How much faster could you deploy new applications?"
   - Target: 10x faster deployment (weeks → days)
   - Example: 12-week edge deployment → 1.5 weeks = $500K in incremental revenue

**Metrics Discovery Questions:**
- "What's your annual hypervisor licensing budget?"
- "How much do you spend on infrastructure (servers, power, cooling)?"
- "What's the cost of downtime for your critical applications?"
- "How long does it take to deploy new infrastructure today?"
- "What's the business impact of performance bottlenecks (lost revenue, customer churn)?"

- **Highlight Quantum:** "Given your 3-5 year roadmap, quantum computing readiness should be a criterion"
- **Edge-Cloud Continuum:** "Will you evaluate edge-to-cloud capabilities? That's increasingly critical"

**RFP Response Strategy:**
- Ensure decision criteria favor DWCP strengths (performance, quantum, Wasm)
- Collaborate with champion to include favorable criteria
- If criteria favor competitor, educate on why DWCP criteria matter more

---

#### **Decision Process (D)**
**Objective:** Map out the steps and timeline from evaluation to purchase

**Typical Enterprise Decision Process:**
```
Week 1-2:   Awareness & Initial Research
Week 3-4:   Vendor Briefings (3-5 vendors)
Week 5-8:   RFI / RFP Issuance
Week 9-12:  Vendor Presentations & Demos
Week 13-15: Short-list (2-3 vendors)
Week 16-20: Proof of Concept (POC)
Week 21-22: POC Results & Business Case
Week 23-24: Executive Decision
Week 25-28: Contract Negotiation
Week 29-30: Legal & Procurement
Week 31-32: Purchase Order

Total: 6-8 months (typical)
```

**Discovery Questions:**
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "What steps are involved in your evaluation process?"
- "Who needs to approve at each stage?"
- "Have you done a project like this before? What was the timeline?"
- "Are there any upcoming deadlines driving this (budget cycle, contract renewal)?"

**Accelerating the Decision Process:**
- **Pilot Approach:** Start small (edge, AI/ML), expand later (reduces risk, speeds decision)
- **Budget Cycles:** Align to fiscal year planning (Q3-Q4 for next year budget)
- **Competitive Deadlines:** VMware renewal, competitor contract expiration
- **Executive Sponsorship:** CIO/CTO support can shorten process by 30-50%

**Red Flags (Stalled Deals):**
- No clear timeline or "we're just researching"
- Decision process keeps changing or extending
- Champion can't articulate next steps
- Economic buyer not engaged

#### **Value Proposition (Edge Computing)**

**Primary Message:**
"Deploy once in WebAssembly, run anywhere - from constrained edge devices to massive cloud clusters with centralized management for 10,000+ edge nodes, sub-millisecond latency, and true hardware portability."

**Value Pillars:**
1. **Resource Efficiency** - Wasm runs on devices with 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core
2. **Portability** - Same code runs on x86, ARM, RISC-V (no recompilation)
3. **Latency** - Sub-millisecond local processing (<1ms typical)
4. **Management** - Centralized control for 10,000+ edge nodes from single console
5. **Performance** - 10x faster execution vs container-based edge platforms

**Proof Points:**
- Retail chain: 2,400 edge locations with unified deployment (x86 and ARM mix)
- Telco: 5G edge infrastructure with <5ms latency guarantee
- Manufacturing: Industry 4.0 real-time ML inference (1,000+ edge devices)
- CDN provider: 10x faster Wasm execution vs container-based edge

---

#### **Edge-Specific Messaging**

**Why WebAssembly for Edge:**
"Traditional VMs and containers are too heavy for edge devices. WebAssembly provides:
- **Tiny footprint:** 1-10MB vs 100MB+ for containers
- **Fast startup:** <1ms vs seconds for containers
- **Architecture portability:** Same binary runs on x86, ARM, RISC-V
- **Security:** Sandboxed by default, capability-based security
- **Performance:** Near-native speed (within 5% of bare metal)"

**Edge-Cloud Continuum:**
"DWCP provides seamless edge-to-cloud workload migration:
- **Develop once:** Write in Rust/C++/Go, compile to Wasm
- **Deploy anywhere:** Edge, data center, cloud (no changes)
- **Manage centrally:** Single console for all edge + cloud nodes
- **Optimize automatically:** Neural orchestration places workloads optimally (edge vs cloud)"

---

#### **Objection Handling (Edge Computing)**

**Objection:** "We're using Kubernetes at the edge. Why switch to DWCP?"
**Response:**
"K8s can work for edge, but it has limitations:
1. **Resource Overhead:** K8s requires 2-4GB RAM minimum; Wasm runs in 512MB
2. **Complexity:** K8s is notoriously complex; DWCP is simpler for edge use cases
3. **Portability:** K8s containers are architecture-specific; Wasm is portable (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
4. **Performance:** DWCP's native Wasm is 10x faster than K8s with WASI
5. **Hybrid:** Run K8s on DWCP infrastructure if you want both

Many edge customers run K8s in the cloud, DWCP at the edge - best of both worlds."

---

**Objection:** "Our edge devices are too constrained for a hypervisor."
**Response:**
"Great point - traditional hypervisors (VMware, Hyper-V) won't work on constrained edge devices. That's exactly why DWCP uses WebAssembly, not traditional VMs:
- **Minimal footprint:** DWCP edge agent is <50MB
- **Low resource usage:** Runs on 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core
- **No VM overhead:** Wasm executes directly (near-native performance)
- **Proven:** Retail customer runs DWCP on 2,400 ARM devices with 1GB RAM

Can I show you a demo running on a Raspberry Pi?"

### 4.3 Discovery Best Practices

#### **Do's:**
1. **Listen More Than Talk** - 70/30 rule (customer talks 70%, you talk 30%)
2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions** - "Tell me about..." vs "Do you have...?"
3. **Dig Deeper** - "Tell me more about that" "Why is that important?" "What's the impact?"
4. **Take Notes** - Document key points, pain points, requirements (use CRM)
5. **Summarize** - "Let me make sure I understand..." (validate understanding)
6. **Tailor to Audience** - Executives want business value, engineers want technical details
7. **Build Rapport** - Find common ground, be genuinely curious
8. **Multi-Threading** - Talk to multiple stakeholders (champion, economic buyer, users, IT)

#### **Don'ts:**
1. **Don't Pitch Too Early** - Understand before you prescribe
2. **Don't Assume** - Validate assumptions with questions
3. **Don't Lead the Witness** - Avoid questions that telegraph the "right" answer
4. **Don't Interrogate** - Make it a conversation, not an inquisition
5. **Don't Miss Pain** - If they mention a pain point, dig deeper (don't skip)
6. **Don't Talk Over** - Let them finish, resist urge to interrupt
7. **Don't Fake It** - If you don't know, say "Let me find out and get back to you"

---

### 5.4 Demo Do's and Don'ts

#### **Do's:**
1. **Customize to Customer** - Show their use case, not generic demo
2. **Start with Business Value** - "Here's how DWCP solves [pain point]"
3. **Show, Don't Tell** - Live demo > slides
4. **Benchmark Live** - Run performance test during demo (if safe)
5. **Involve Customer** - Ask them to drive, or pause for questions
6. **Handle Failures Gracefully** - Have backup (screenshots, videos)
7. **Tie to ROI** - "This 10x performance improvement saves you $X"

#### **Don'ts:**
1. **Don't Show Every Feature** - Focus on what matters to customer
2. **Don't Go Too Deep Too Early** - High-level first, details later
3. **Don't Use Jargon** - Explain technical terms for non-technical audience
4. **Don't Run Long** - Respect time, end on schedule
5. **Don't Fake It** - If a feature doesn't exist, say so (roadmap instead)
6. **Don't Ignore Questions** - Pause for questions, don't barrel through
7. **Don't Leave Without Next Steps** - Always schedule follow-up before ending

## Part 8: Pricing & Negotiation

### 8.1 Pricing Models

#### **Model 1: Per-Socket Pricing (Standard)**
- **Structure:** Annual subscription per CPU socket
- **Pricing Tiers:**
  - Community Edition: Free (up to 3 hosts)
  - Professional: $1,500/socket/year (3-49 sockets)
  - Enterprise: $2,500/socket/year (50-499 sockets)
  - Enterprise+: $3,000/socket/year (500+ sockets, volume discounts)

**Example:**
- Customer with 100 sockets
- Enterprise tier: $2,500/socket × 100 = $250K/year
- 3-year commit discount (15%): $212K/year × 3 = $636K total

---

#### **Model 2: Per-Core Pricing (Alternative)**
- **Structure:** Annual subscription per CPU core
- **Pricing Tiers:**
  - Professional: $200/core/year (up to 499 cores)
  - Enterprise: $175/core/year (500-4,999 cores)
  - Enterprise+: $150/core/year (5,000+ cores)

**Example:**
- Customer with 100 sockets × 16 cores = 1,600 cores
- Enterprise tier: $175/core × 1,600 = $280K/year

**When to Use:** Customers with high core-count CPUs (32, 64+ cores per socket)

---

#### **Model 3: Per-Node Pricing (Edge Computing)**
- **Structure:** Annual subscription per edge node
- **Pricing Tiers:**
  - 1-49 nodes: $500/node/year
  - 50-499 nodes: $250/node/year
  - 500-4,999 nodes: $150/node/year
  - 5,000+ nodes: $120/node/year

**Example:**
- Customer with 1,000 edge nodes
- Tier: $150/node × 1,000 = $150K/year

**When to Use:** Edge computing deployments with many small nodes

---

#### **Model 4: Consumption-Based Pricing (Cloud Providers)**
- **Structure:** Pay only for active usage (VMs, cores, nodes)
- **Pricing:** $0.02-0.05 per core-hour (varies by tier)
- **Billing:** Monthly in arrears based on actual usage

**Example:**
- Cloud provider runs average 10,000 cores continuously
- $0.03/core-hour × 10,000 cores × 730 hours/month = $219K/month = $2.6M/year

**When to Use:** Cloud service providers with variable workloads

---

### 8.2 Discounting Guidelines

#### **Volume Discounts**
- **50-99 sockets:** 5% off list price
- **100-499 sockets:** 10% off list price
- **500-999 sockets:** 15% off list price
- **1,000+ sockets:** 20% off list price (case-by-case, requires VP approval)

#### **Multi-Year Commit Discounts**
- **1 year:** 0% discount (list price)
- **2 years:** 10% discount
- **3 years:** 15% discount
- **4-5 years:** 20% discount (requires VP approval)

#### **Prepayment Discounts**
- **Annual prepay:** 0% (standard)
- **Multi-year prepay:** Additional 5% discount (on top of multi-year discount)

#### **Strategic Discounts (Requires Approval)**
- **First customer in vertical/region:** Up to 25% (SVP approval)
- **Lighthouse customer (referenceable):** Up to 30% (SVP approval)
- **Competitive displacement (VMware):** Up to 20% (VP approval)
- **Large deal (>$1M ARR):** Up to 25% (SVP approval)

**Example Combined Discounting:**
- Customer: 500 sockets, 3-year commit, annual prepay, lighthouse customer
- List price: $3,000/socket/year (Enterprise+ tier)
- Volume discount (500 sockets): 15% → $2,550/socket/year
- Multi-year commit (3 years): 15% → $2,167/socket/year
- Prepayment: 5% → $2,059/socket/year
- Lighthouse customer: 10% → $1,853/socket/year
- **Final price: $1,853/socket/year × 500 sockets × 3 years = $2.78M (38% off list)**

---

### 8.3 Negotiation Tactics

#### **Anchoring**
- Start with list price, then offer discounts
- "List price is $3,000/socket, but for a 3-year commit we can do $2,550"
- Never start with the lowest price - leave room to negotiate

#### **Value Reinforcement**
- Constantly tie price back to value delivered
- "At $2.5M over 3 years, you're saving $4.2M on VMware licensing - that's a 168% ROI"

#### **Scarcity & Urgency**
- "This pricing is available if we sign by end of quarter"
- "Lighthouse customer discount is only for our first 10 customers"

#### **Quid Pro Quo**
- Never give a concession without getting something in return
- **Customer:** "Can you do 25% off?"
- **You:** "I can work on that if you commit to 3 years and become a reference customer"

#### **Higher Authority**
- "I need to get approval from my VP for that level of discount"
- Buys time, shows you're negotiating hard for them

#### **Walk-Away Power**
- Be willing to walk away from a bad deal
- "At that price, I can't make this work. Let's revisit when budget increases"

---

### 8.4 Common Negotiation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Customer Wants Deeper Discount**
**Customer:** "We need 40% off to make this work."
**Response:**
1. **Understand Why:** "Help me understand - what's driving the need for 40% off?"
2. **Value Reinforcement:** "At current pricing, you're saving $4.2M vs VMware - does a bigger discount change the business case?"
3. **Quid Pro Quo:** "I can explore additional discounts if you:
   - Commit to 3 years (not 1 year)
   - Prepay annually (not quarterly)
   - Become a lighthouse reference customer (case study, press release)"
4. **Counter-Offer:** "I can do 30% off with those commitments. Does that work?"

---

**Scenario 2: Customer Wants to Split the Deal (Start Small)**
**Customer:** "We want to start with just 50 sockets, then expand."
**Response:**
1. **Understand:** "Makes sense to start small - what's your expansion timeline and target size?"
2. **Lock in Future Pricing:** "Let's structure it with a ramp:
   - Year 1: 50 sockets @ $2,500/socket = $125K
   - Year 2: 200 sockets @ $2,500/socket = $500K
   - Year 3: 500 sockets @ $2,200/socket = $1.1M (volume discount kicks in)"
3. **Commitment:** "This pricing assumes a 3-year commit to the ramp - does that work?"

---

**Scenario 3: Customer Wants Perpetual License, Not Subscription**
**Customer:** "We prefer perpetual licenses, not annual subscriptions."
**Response:**
1. **Explain Strategy:** "We've moved to subscription for continuous innovation and support"
2. **Value:** "Subscription includes:
   - Free upgrades (4 major releases per year)
   - 24/7 support
   - Access to new features (quantum, neural enhancements)
   - Vs perpetual: Pay upfront, then annual maintenance (similar total cost)"
3. **Option:** "We can do perpetual + annual maintenance if required:
   - Perpetual: $10,000/socket (one-time)
   - Annual maintenance: $2,000/socket/year (20%)
   - Year 1 cost: $12,000/socket
   - Year 3 total cost: $16,000/socket (vs subscription: $7,500/socket)
   - Subscription saves you 53% over 3 years"

---

**Scenario 4: Customer Wants Payment Terms (Net-90, Quarterly)**
**Customer:** "We need Net-90 payment terms and quarterly billing."
**Response:**
1. **Standard Terms:** "Our standard terms are Net-30, annual billing"
2. **Quid Pro Quo:** "I can offer Net-60 and quarterly billing if you:
   - Commit to 3 years (not annual renewal)
   - Agree to 5% price increase (to offset cash flow impact)"
3. **Alternative:** "Or, if you prepay annually at Net-30, I can offer 5% discount instead"

---

### 8.5 Contract Terms & Red Lines

#### **Standard Contract Terms**
- **License Term:** 1-3 years (annual renewal or multi-year commit)
- **Payment Terms:** Net-30, annual billing in advance
- **Support:** 24/7 premium support included
- **SLA:** 99.9% uptime (monthly measurement)
- **Liability Cap:** 12 months of fees paid
- **Indemnification:** Standard IP indemnification
- **Termination:** 90 days notice, no early termination without cause

#### **Negotiable Terms (Case-by-Case)**
- **Payment Terms:** Net-60 or quarterly billing (with price adjustment)
- **Liability Cap:** 24 months of fees (for large enterprise deals)
- **Custom SLA:** 99.95% or custom performance SLAs (premium pricing)
- **Professional Services:** Custom migration services, training, integration

#### **Red Lines (Non-Negotiable Without SVP Approval)**
- **Unlimited Liability:** We cap liability (12-24 months fees), no unlimited
- **Source Code Escrow:** Available for enterprise customers, but requires legal review
- **Warranties:** Standard warranties (software performs as documented), no custom warranties
- **Most Favored Customer:** No MFC clauses (prohibits price optimization)

---

## Part 9: Closing Strategies

### 9.1 Trial Close Techniques

**Purpose:** Test readiness to close without formally asking

**Techniques:**
1. **Assumptive Close:** "Should we target a Q4 start date for the migration?"
2. **Choice Close:** "Do you prefer annual or multi-year pricing?"
3. **Summary Close:** "So we're aligned on 500 sockets, 3-year commit, $2.2M total - is that right?"
4. **Timeline Close:** "What needs to happen between now and signing the contract?"

---

### 9.2 Final Close Techniques

#### **Direct Close**
"Based on everything we've discussed - performance, cost savings, quantum capabilities - are you ready to move forward?"

**When to Use:** Strong buying signals, MEDDPICC complete, champion committed

---

#### **Urgency Close**
"If we sign by end of quarter, I can include the migration services ($100K value) at no cost. Can we target [date]?"

**When to Use:** Late in quarter, budget deadline, competitive pressure

---

#### **Risk Reversal Close**
"Let's do this: Sign the contract, start the migration. If after 90 days DWCP doesn't deliver, we'll revert to VMware at our cost and refund your investment. Zero risk to you. Sound fair?"

**When to Use:** Customer has risk concerns, needs reassurance

---

#### **Summary Close**
"Let me summarize what we've agreed:
- 500 sockets, 3-year commit
- $2.2M total ($733K/year)
- Savings: $4.2M vs VMware over 3 years
- Migration services included ($100K value)
- 90-day rollback guarantee

This delivers everything you need - should we get the paperwork started?"

**When to Use:** After lengthy negotiation, to confirm and move forward

---

### 9.3 Closing Timeline

**Typical Enterprise Sale Timeline:**
- **Month 1-2:** Discovery, MEDDPICC qualification
- **Month 3-4:** Demo, technical validation, executive briefing
- **Month 5-6:** Proof of concept (POC)
- **Month 7-8:** Business case, proposal, negotiation
- **Month 9-10:** Contract negotiation, legal review, procurement
- **Month 11-12:** Contract signed, kick-off

**Accelerated Timeline (3-6 months):**
- Leverage existing pain (VMware renewal in 60 days)
- Executive sponsorship (CIO mandates evaluation)
- Urgent business need (new data center, M&A, compliance deadline)

---

## Part 10: Post-Sale Handoff
