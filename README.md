# NovaCron

NovaCron is a distributed VM management system with advanced migration capabilities.

## Project Overview

NovaCron provides a robust platform for managing virtualized workloads across distributed nodes, with a focus on efficient and reliable migration between hosts. It's designed to handle various virtualization technologies and optimize workload placement based on resource availability and constraints.

## Key Features

- **Advanced VM Migration**: Support for cold, warm, and live migration with minimal downtime
- **WAN-Optimized Transfers**: Efficient transfer of VM data across wide area networks with compression and delta sync
- **Multi-Driver Support**: Compatible with various virtualization technologies (KVM, containers)
- **Resource-Aware Scheduling**: Intelligent VM placement based on available resources
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Distributed architecture for scaling across multiple nodes
