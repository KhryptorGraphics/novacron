## Technical Achievements

### KVM Manager Improvements
```go
// Enhanced executeCommand with proper error handling
func executeCommand(cmd string) error {
    parts := strings.Fields(cmd)
    if len(parts) == 0 {
        return fmt.Errorf("empty command")
    }
    
    execCmd := exec.Command(parts[0], parts[1:]...)
    output, err := execCmd.CombinedOutput()
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("command failed: %s, output: %s, error: %w", 
            cmd, string(output), err)
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

### Analytics Pipeline Framework
```go
// Comprehensive pipeline processing with error handling
func (e *AnalyticsEngine) processPipeline(pipeline *Pipeline) {
    ctx := &PipelineContext{
        StartTime:      time.Now(),
        MetricRegistry: e.metricRegistry,
        HistoryManager: e.historyManager,
        Data:           make(map[string]interface{}),
    }
    
    // Sequential execution: Collectors -> Analyzers -> Visualizers -> Reporters
    for _, stage := range []string{"collectors", "analyzers", "visualizers", "reporters"} {
        if err := e.executeStage(stage, pipeline, ctx); err != nil {
            pipeline.RecordError(err)
            return
        }
    }
}
```

### Monitoring Integration
```go
// Real KVM metrics collection with fallback to simulation
func collectVMMetrics(registry *monitoring.MetricRegistry, kvmManager *hypervisor.KVMManager) {
    if kvmManager != nil {
        // Collect real metrics from KVM
        vms, err := kvmManager.ListVMs(ctx)
        for _, vmInfo := range vms {
            vmMetrics, _ := kvmManager.GetVMMetrics(ctx, vmInfo.ID)
            // Register metrics in registry
        }
    } else {
        // Fallback to simulated metrics
        simulateVMMetrics(registry)
    }
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Mitigated Risks ‚úÖ
- **KVM Integration Complexity**: Resolved with comprehensive libvirt integration
