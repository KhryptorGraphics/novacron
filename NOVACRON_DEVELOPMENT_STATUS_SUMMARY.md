## Conclusion

NovaCron shows promising architecture and design but has significant implementation gaps, particularly in cloud provider integration, hypervisor management, and advanced features. With the structured roadmap above, the system can reach production readiness in approximately 30 weeks, with core functionality available much earlier (6-8 weeks).

Key recommendations:
1. Prioritize AWS provider and KVM manager implementation to establish core functionality
2. Focus on monitoring integration for early visibility and operational insights
3. Implement cloud providers sequentially rather than in parallel
4. Establish comprehensive testing early, especially for cloud provider integration
5. Consider feature flagging for gradual rollout of advanced capabilities
