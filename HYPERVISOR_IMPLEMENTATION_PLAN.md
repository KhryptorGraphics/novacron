## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the hypervisor layer for NovaCron. By following this plan, the development team can systematically address the current gaps and deliver a robust, production-ready hypervisor implementation.

The phased approach ensures that core functionality is completed first, providing a solid foundation for advanced features. The focus on error handling, performance, and testing will ensure the reliability and maintainability of the hypervisor code.

With a complete KVM implementation and a plugin system for additional hypervisors, NovaCron will be positioned as a flexible, multi-hypervisor platform capable of managing diverse virtualization environments.
