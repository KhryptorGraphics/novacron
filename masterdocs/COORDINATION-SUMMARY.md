## Project Context

### Current Phase Status

**Phase 2:** ✅ COMPLETE
- All 6 core DWCP components implemented
- ~25,000 lines of production code
- 29/29 ASS/ACP tests passing
- 8/9 HDE tests passing
- 90%+ test coverage target achieved

**Phase 0:** 🎯 READY FOR EXECUTION
- Benchmark suite ready
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Research worker assigned

**Phases 1-5:** 🎯 PLANNED AND ASSIGNED
- All workers assigned to specific phases

### Performance Targets (DWCP v3)

> [!WARNING]
> **[CORRECTION — fabricated metric]** The figures below (92% WAN bandwidth, 28x compression, 3.3x migration) were fabricated (traced to a benchmark package with zero real `dwcp` imports; see `novacron-38p` / `STATUS.md`). Real, code-verified evidence: WAN compression gives ~2.55–2.74x FASTER migration only on compressible VM memory (SLOWER on incompressible data and on LAN/loopback, where it is 1.5–2.3x slower). Do not treat the original numbers below as measured.

| Metric | Target | Phase 2 Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| WAN Bandwidth | 92% | 🎯 Design validated |
| Compression Ratio | 28x | ✅ 10-40x (HDE v3) |
| VM Migration Speedup | 3.3x | 🎯 45-90s for 2GB |
| Workload Speedup | 2-3x | 🎯 ITP v3 ready |
| Datacenter Throughput | 10-100 Gbps | ✅ RDMA support |
| Internet Throughput | 100-900 Mbps | ✅ TCP optimized |
| Byzantine Tolerance | 33% | ✅ PBFT validated |
| State Staleness | <5s | ✅ ASS v3 ready |
