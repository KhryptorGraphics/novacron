## Resource Allocation

The implementation requires the following resource allocation:

| Workstream | Required Skills | Estimated FTEs |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cloud Provider | AWS/Azure/GCP expertise, Go | 2-3 |
| KVM Hypervisor | Libvirt, virtualization, Go | 1-2 |
| Monitoring & Analytics | Metrics, alerting, time-series DB | 2 |
| ML & Advanced Analytics | ML, statistics, data science | 2-3 |
| Frontend & UI | React, TypeScript, visualization | 2 |
| Testing & DevOps | CI/CD, testing, automation | 1-2 |

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Resource constraints | High | Medium | Prioritize critical path items, phase implementation |
| Technical complexity | Medium | High | Modular design, clear interfaces, incremental development |
| Integration challenges | High | Medium | Early integration testing, clear API contracts |
| Performance at scale | High | Medium | Early load testing, performance benchmarks |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict change management, MVP focus |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Functionality**: All planned features are implemented and working correctly
2. **Performance**: The system meets performance benchmarks under expected load
3. **Reliability**: The system demonstrates >99.9% uptime in testing
4. **Usability**: User testing confirms intuitive operation and value delivery
5. **Integration**: All components work together seamlessly

## Governance and Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:

1. **Weekly Status Reports**: Updates on each workstream
2. **Milestone Reviews**: At the end of each phase
