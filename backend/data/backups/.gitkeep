# Backup Storage Directory

This directory is used by the NovaCron Advanced Backup System to store:
- VM backups and incremental backup chains
- CBT (Changed Block Tracking) metadata
- Deduplication chunks and indexes
- Backup manifests and metadata
- Restoration temporary files

The backup system automatically manages this directory structure.
