# Provider Integration & Monitoring Backend Action Plan

_Last updated: April 11, 2025_

## Objective

Complete the monitoring backend by implementing and validating real provider integrations (KVM, containerd, AWS, Azure, GCP) and finishing integration/unit tests for all monitoring components.

---

## 1. Replace Mock/Skeleton Providers with Real Integrations

### AWS Provider
- Integrate AWS SDK for Go (v2).
- Implement real authentication, region/zone selection, and error handling.
- Implement:
  - Instance management (list, create, delete, start, stop, resize, metrics).
  - Storage management (volumes, snapshots).
  - Network management (VPCs, subnets).
  - Pricing and region discovery.
- Implement CloudWatch metric collection for VM telemetry.
- Add robust error handling and logging.

### Azure Provider
- Integrate Azure SDK for Go.
- Implement real authentication (service principal, managed identity).
- Implement:
  - VM management (list, create, delete, start, stop, resize, metrics).
  - Disk and snapshot management.
  - Virtual network management.
  - Pricing and region discovery.
- Implement Azure Monitor metric collection for VM telemetry.
- Add robust error handling and logging.

### GCP Provider
- Integrate Google Cloud Go SDK.
- Implement real authentication (service account, OAuth).
- Implement:
  - Instance management (list, create, delete, start, stop, resize, metrics).
  - Disk and snapshot management.
  - VPC/network management.
  - Pricing and region discovery.
- Implement Cloud Monitoring metric collection for VM telemetry.
- Add robust error handling and logging.

### KVM Provider
- Complete kvm_vm_manager.go with libvirt/go-libvirt integration.
- Implement real VM lifecycle and metric collection.
- Add error handling and logging.

### Containerd Provider
- Implement a new containerd_vm_manager.go using containerd Go client.
- Implement container lifecycle management and metric collection.
- Add error handling and logging.

## 2. Integration and Unit Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests for each provider (mocking cloud APIs where needed).
- Write integration tests for:
  - Provider initialization and authentication.
  - Instance/VM lifecycle operations.
  - Metric collection and telemetry.
  - Storage and network operations.
- Ensure all tests are automated and run in CI.
- Achieve at least 80% code coverage for provider and monitoring code.

---

## 3. Monitoring Backend Enhancements

- Refactor collectors.go, distributed_metric_collector.go, and analytics_engine.go to support new provider integrations.
- Ensure all metric types (CPU, memory, disk, network, custom) are supported for each provider.
- Implement robust error handling, retries, and fallback logic in collectors.
- Add logging and observability for all monitoring operations.

---

## 4. Documentation

- Update README.md and provider-specific docs to reflect real integration details.
- Document configuration, authentication, and usage for each provider.
- Provide example configuration files for each provider.

## 5. Milestones

| Milestone                        | Target Date   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| AWS Provider Integration         | 2 weeks      |
| Azure Provider Integration       | 2 weeks      |
| GCP Provider Integration         | 2 weeks      |
| KVM/Containerd Integration       | 2 weeks      |
| Unit/Integration Test Coverage   | 2 weeks      |
| Monitoring Backend Refactor      | 1 week       |
| Documentation & Examples         | 1 week       |

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- All provider integrations are functional and pass integration tests.
- Monitoring backend collects real metrics from all supported providers.
- All code is covered by unit/integration tests and runs in CI.
- Documentation is complete and up to date.

_This plan should be used as the technical reference for completing provider integrations and monitoring backend work._
