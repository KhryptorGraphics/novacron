# Workload-Aware Cloud Resource Management

This package provides workload classification and optimization tools for the hybrid cloud orchestrator.

## Components

- **WorkloadClassifier**: Analyzes workload metrics to determine the type of workload and its characteristics
- **WorkloadTypes**: Defines the different workload types (web server, batch processing, database, etc.)
- **ProviderFitScore**: Scores how well a cloud provider fits a particular workload

## Integration

This package is designed to be integrated with the hybrid cloud orchestrator to enable workload-aware resource placement. 

### Module Integration

To properly integrate this package into the build system, update the main `go.mod` file to include this package:

```go
module github.com/novacron/backend/core

go 1.20

require (
    // other dependencies
)
```

### Import Path

The correct import path for this package is:

```go
import "github.com/novacron/backend/core/cloud/workload"
```

## Workload Classification

The workload classifier analyzes metrics such as:

- CPU and memory utilization patterns
- I/O access patterns
- Network traffic patterns
- Time-based usage patterns

Based on these metrics, it can classify workloads into categories like:

- Web server workloads
- Batch processing workloads
- Database workloads
- ML/AI workloads
- Analytics workloads
- Development/testing workloads

## Cloud Provider Optimization

For each workload type, the classifier can recommend the most appropriate:

- Cloud provider
- Instance type
- Pricing model (on-demand, reserved, spot)
- Geographic region

## Usage

```go
// Create a new workload classifier
classifier := workload.NewWorkloadClassifier()

// Classify a workload based on metrics
characteristics := classifier.ClassifyWorkload(metrics)

// Optimize placement across providers
providerScores := classifier.OptimizeWorkloadPlacement(profile)
```

## Further Development

Future enhancements:

1. ML-based workload prediction
2. Automatic workload migration triggers
3. Cost optimization recommendations
4. Performance benchmark-based placement
5. Compliance-aware workload placement
