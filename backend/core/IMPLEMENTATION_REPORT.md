**Test Results**: âœ… **6/8 Raft tests passing**, âœ… **4/6 lock tests passing**

**Working Features**:
- âœ… Single-node and multi-node leader election
- âœ… Log replication and consistency
- âœ… Command application to state machine
- âœ… Basic distributed lock acquisition and release
- âœ… In-memory transport for testing
- âœ… HTTP transport for production

**Known Issues**:
- Leader failover test needs network partition simulation improvements
- Lock conflict resolution needs refinement for multi-client scenarios

### âœ… VM Lifecycle Management (Weeks 5-6) - COMPLETED
**Location**: `/home/kp/novacron/backend/core/vm/`

**Implemented Components**:
- **Enhanced Lifecycle Manager** (`lifecycle_manager.go`): Complete VM state management
- **VM State Machine** (`state_machine.go`): Validated state transitions
- **Health Monitoring** (`health_checker.go`): Comprehensive health checks with metrics
- **Event System** (`event_bus.go`): Event-driven architecture for VM operations
- **Checkpoint & Snapshot Support** (`checkpointer.go`): VM backup and restore capabilities
- **Live Migration Support**: Integration with existing migration systems

**Test Results**: âœ… **All compilation successful**, integration with existing VM systems

**Key Features**:
- Complete VM lifecycle from creation to termination
- State transition validation with rollback support
- Real-time health monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Event-driven notifications for all lifecycle changes
- Checkpoint and snapshot management
- Integration with live migration systems
