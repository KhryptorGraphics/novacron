# NovaCron Storage Subsystem

The storage subsystem provides a flexible and extensible storage abstraction layer for NovaCron's virtual machine and container workloads. It supports multiple storage backends through a plugin-based architecture.

## Architecture

The storage subsystem is built around the following principles:

1. **Plugin-based architecture**: Storage drivers are implemented as plugins that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
2. **Common interface**: All storage drivers implement a common interface for consistent interaction.
3. **Distributed operation**: Support for distributed storage systems with replication and high availability.
4. **Performance optimizations**: Including caching, compression, and deduplication.
5. **Scalability**: Ability to scale from small deployments to large clusters.

## Available Storage Drivers

### 1. Ceph Storage Driver (`ceph`)

A distributed storage driver for Ceph, providing:

- RBD (RADOS Block Device) integration
- Distributed block storage with replication
- Snapshot and cloning support
- Performance monitoring and metrics

**Use cases**: Production environments requiring high availability, replication, and scalability.

### 2. Network File Storage Driver (`netfs`)

Integration with traditional network file systems:

- NFS v3/v4 support
- SMB/CIFS support (for Windows integration)
- Dynamic mount management
- Path-based volume mapping

**Use cases**: Environments with existing NAS infrastructure or simpler deployments.

### 3. Object Storage Driver (`object-storage`)

Integration with cloud and on-premises object storage:

- Support for S3, Swift, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage
- Bucket and object lifecycle management
- Multi-part upload capabilities
- Pre-signed URL generation

**Use cases**: Cloud-native workloads, backup storage, and archival use cases.

## Storage Operations

All storage drivers support the following operations:

1. **Volume Management**:
   - Create, delete, resize volumes
   - Clone volumes
   - Create and manage snapshots

2. **Data Operations**:
   - Read/write operations with offset support
   - Efficient data transfer

3. **Metrics and Monitoring**:
   - Usage statistics
   - Performance metrics
   - Health monitoring

## Configuration

Each storage driver has its own configuration options, typically defined in a configuration file or through environment variables. Common configuration options include:

- Authentication credentials
- Connection parameters
- Performance tuning options
- Feature flags

## Development and Extension

To implement a new storage driver:

1. Create a new package under `backend/core/plugins/storage/`
2. Implement the StorageDriver interface
3. Expose driver information through a plugin info struct
4. Register with the plugin system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hybrid Storage**: Automatic tiering between different storage types
2. **Data Migration**: Online migration of data between storage backends
3. **Storage Policies**: Rule-based storage provisioning based on workload needs
4. **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all storage backends
5. **QoS**: Quality of Service controls for prioritizing workloads
