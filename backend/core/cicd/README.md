# CI/CD Integration System

The CI/CD Integration System provides seamless connectivity with popular continuous integration and continuous deployment platforms. It enables NovaCron to automate software delivery pipelines, deployment processes, and artifact management across development environments.

## Architecture

The CI/CD integration architecture consists of the following components:

1. **CI/CD Manager**: Core component that orchestrates integrations with CI/CD platforms
2. **Provider Interfaces**: Adapters for different CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
3. **Deployment Targets**: Definitions of environments where artifacts can be deployed
4. **Pipeline Models**: Representations of CI/CD workflows and their execution stages

## Supported CI/CD Providers

The system integrates with multiple CI/CD platforms:

1. **Jenkins**
   - Job management and triggering
   - Build artifacts handling
   - Pipeline visualization
   - Credentials management

2. **GitHub Actions**
   - Workflow management
   - Repository-based CI/CD
   - Artifact storage and retrieval
   - Secret management

3. **GitLab CI**
   - Pipeline definition and execution
   - Job artifacts management
   - Runner management
   - Environment deployment

4. **Custom Providers**
   - Extensible interface for custom CI/CD systems
   - Webhook-based integration
   - Artifact upload/download

## Core Features

### Pipeline Management

- Create, update, and delete pipeline definitions
- Trigger pipeline execution with custom parameters
- Monitor pipeline execution status in real-time
- Access detailed build logs and execution metrics
- Visualize pipeline execution flow

### Artifact Management

- Track artifacts produced by pipeline runs
- Version artifacts with metadata
- Store artifacts in configurable repositories
- Download artifacts for deployment or testing
- Validate artifact integrity with checksums

### Deployment Automation

- Define deployment targets for different environments
- Automate deployment of artifacts to targets
- Track deployment history and versions
- Execute deployment-specific workflows
- Perform rollbacks to previous versions

### Environment Management

- Define environment-specific configurations
- Manage secrets and credentials securely
- Create environment promotion workflows
- Validate environment states
- Track environment deployment history

## Using the CI/CD Integration

### Registering a CI/CD Provider

```go
// Create a CI/CD manager
cicdManager := cicd.NewCICDManager()

// Initialize the manager
ctx := context.Background()
cicdManager.Initialize(ctx)

// Create a Jenkins provider
jenkinsProvider := jenkins.NewJenkinsProvider(
    "jenkins-prod",
    "https://jenkins.example.com",
    "admin",
    "api-token",
)

// Register the provider
cicdManager.RegisterProvider(jenkinsProvider)
```

### Creating and Triggering a Pipeline

```go
// Create a pipeline definition
pipeline := &cicd.Pipeline{
    Name:          "backend-build",
    Provider:      cicd.ProviderJenkins,
    RepositoryURL: "https://github.com/example/backend",
    Reference:     "main",
    Environment: map[string]string{
        "BUILD_ENV": "production",
    },
    WebhookURL: "https://webhook.example.com/pipeline-notifications",
}

// Create the pipeline
cicdManager.CreatePipeline(ctx, "jenkins-prod", pipeline)

// Trigger the pipeline with parameters
params := map[string]string{
    "VERSION": "1.2.3",
    "RELEASE": "true",
}
cicdManager.TriggerPipeline(ctx, "jenkins-prod", pipeline.ID, params)
```

### Managing Deployments

```go
// Register a deployment target
target := &cicd.DeploymentTarget{
    ID:          "prod-cluster",
    Name:        "Production Kubernetes Cluster",
    Environment: "production",
    Hosts:       []string{"k8s-prod.example.com"},
    Credentials: map[string]string{
        "kube_config": "/path/to/kubeconfig",
    },
    Config: map[string]string{
        "namespace": "backend-services",
        "strategy":  "rolling-update",
    },
}
cicdManager.RegisterDeploymentTarget(target)

// Create a deployment
deployment := &cicd.Deployment{
    PipelineID:  "pipeline-123",
    ArtifactID:  "artifact-456",
    TargetID:    "prod-cluster",
    Version:     "1.2.3",
    ApprovedBy:  "user@example.com",
    CanRollback: true,
}
cicdManager.CreateDeployment(ctx, "jenkins-prod", deployment)

// Execute the deployment
cicdManager.ExecuteDeployment(ctx, "jenkins-prod", deployment.ID)
```

## Integration with NovaCron

The CI/CD Integration System connects with other NovaCron components:

1. **VM Management**: Deploy to VMs managed by NovaCron
2. **Network Overlay**: Configure deployment networking
3. **Storage Subsystem**: Store and retrieve artifacts
4. **Federation**: Deploy across multiple clusters

## Implementation Details

- Thread-safe design with RWMutex protection
- Extensible provider interface for additional platforms
- Context-based operations for cancellation support
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Status tracking and state management
