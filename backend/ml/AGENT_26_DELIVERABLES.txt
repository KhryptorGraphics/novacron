3. Check consensus latency progress

Short-term (1-6 hours):
4. Fix bandwidth predictor schema
5. Re-run with aligned data
6. Complete all 4 models
7. Generate unified evaluation report

Integration (1-3 days):
8. Test compression selector with Go DWCP
9. Setup inference pipeline
10. Benchmark inference latency
11. Deploy to staging environment
12. Monitor production metrics
