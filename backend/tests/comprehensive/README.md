# Comprehensive Testing Suite for NovaCron Core Infrastructure

## Test Scope: Phase 1 Core Infrastructure Testing

### 1. Storage Tiering Tests
- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage for storage operations
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-driver backend testing
- **Performance Tests**: Throughput and latency benchmarks
- **Chaos Tests**: Network partitions and node failures

### 2. Distributed State & Consensus Tests  
- **Chaos Engineering**: Network partitions, Byzantine failures
- **Performance Tests**: Consensus latency and throughput
- **Failover Scenarios**: Leader election and recovery

### 3. VM Lifecycle Tests
- **Migration Tests**: Cold, warm, and live migration validation
- **State Transition Tests**: Complete lifecycle validation
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Failure injection and recovery
